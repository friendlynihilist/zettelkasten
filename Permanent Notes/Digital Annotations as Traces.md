## Idea
Given their referential nature or *aboutness* (annotations can exist only with reference to something), they can always be considered as [[Digital Trace]] of a [[Digital Trace]] ("thick data"?), because they act as pointers for an information (the intentional referent) that can be more or less apparent and manifested. This underlines the importance of structuring and representing [[Provenance]] in all those cases in which the target is missing.

Digital annotations are interestingly a good example that can benefit from a processualist view of modelisation in the sense of [[Essentialism vs Processualism in Modelling]], because they are always intermediate tracks of a never ending process of semiosis and signs which indexically stay for something else entirely. That is, their meaning is endless.
