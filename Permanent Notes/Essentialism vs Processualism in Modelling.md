## Idea

We may call this the *essentialist paradigm* of modelling. In this case, models are stable and homological representation of a domain; they capture entities, having troubles in detailing processes (that is, they have to reify process in order to accept them inside the model itself).
The opposite (the *processualist paradigm*) is viewing models as processes or signs (hypoicons) in a semiotic framework, that are always situated and change signification based on their context and use.

Also:

- **Representation as mirroring** vs **representation as mediation**
