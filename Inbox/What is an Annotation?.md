## Cos'è un'annotazione?

“The practice of annotating is a cultural technique used since the Middle Ages in various religious, scholarly and everyday contexts. In the twentieth century it has also become a central principle used in information technological systems.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 1)

“the term ‘annotation’ unites different concepts that vary in coverage, application and direction but which also have instructive parallels. In the Humanities, the term traditionally refers to an additional contextualization and explanation of a text added by the author of the text” ([[@nantke2020]], p. 1)

“Therefore, annotations are equally objects and tools of research, since they build bridges between the perception and the production of knowledge (see Boot 2009, 204). Annotations establish a ‘dialogical structure’ that explicitly links a text passage or an image to its translation, its explanation and/or another artefact, and thereby gives information about the use of the annotated object in a certain time, culture or situation (see Moulin 2010; Meister forthcoming). Hence, annotations always represent a specific perspective on the object, one that is shaped not only by the general circumstances of their origin but also by a designated conceptual purpose and a certain scholarly and/or personal point of view: “The core of explanatory annotation can be found in hermeneutics” (Zirker and Bauer 2017, 147).” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 1)

“Annotating is a so-called scholarly primitive in the sense that it is a scholarly activity performed by scholars across all disciplines (Unsworth 2001; Palmer et al. 2009; Anderson et al. 2010). These annotations are made for different purposes, e.g. in the form of personal comments for scholars to structure and guide their thinking, in the form of tags or codes to analyse the edited sources and gather data, or in the form of links to other research materials to propose relevant relationships between the edited text and something else, be it another text, a photograph depicting an event described in the text or something else entirely (Boot et al. 2017; Ruvane 2005).” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 178)

Schlupkothen/Schmidt suggest a systematic distinction between commentaries (“Kommentare”) and explanatory notes (“Erläuterungen”), two terms that have often been used synonymously. While commentaries refer to the form of the text and editorial decisions related to it, explanatory notes offer additional information regarding the text’s content and thus ensure understandability.

Koolen/Boot approach the topic from a more technical and infrastructural angle: for many editions, it would be desirable to allow for annotation by third-party users on the edition’s website and, where useful, publish them for other users. They discuss difficulties that result from the HTML presentation of the edition and propose a solution based on semantic web technology.

“Boot (2009) described annotations as mesotext between the annotated texts and the scholarly publications based on these annotations.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 178)

## Definire l'annotazione

“systematization cannot be achieved by clear distinctions between analogue and digital or by allocating each example of annotation to one specific category” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 6)

“the construction of annotation tools is always shaped by methodological assumptions and requirements and, conversely, the use of a certain tool determines the method(s) of annotating” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 7)

“Definitions of the term “annotation” typically focus on either procedural (i.e., process-related), technical (i.e., markup-related) or conceptual (i.e., semanticsrelated) aspects, sometimes also combinations of the different layers (Goecke et al. 2010; Ide and Pustejovsky 2017). The notion we follow in this article is loosely based on the concept of Annotation Graphs (Bird and Liberman 2001), which can be used to represent an unlimited number of annotation layers, while links between the text and annotations can be established in an unrestricted way (Witt et al. 2007b; Ide and Suderman 2007). Specifically, we view annotations as secondary research data added to primary research data.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 300)

“Annotations are, therefore, part of the metadata that also include general information on the primary data (author/creator, modality, creation date etc.)” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 300)

## Annotazioni digitali

“From the perspective of Information Technology, the term ‘annotation’ can already refer to the use of processable markup on data sets” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 1)

“In this context, the explanatory function of annotations aims at making a given text semantically accessible to a computer program in the first place. As these annotations usually follow a specific world conception, e.g. described by means of controlled vocabularies or ontology languages, their reasoning systems are often caught within a particular ‘reality’.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 2)
## Come funzionano le annotazioni?

“In current editions that do not support third-party annotations directly, the annotations are made on paper or on a scholar’s personal computer, where they remain private and invisible to others. But these annotations can be rich sources of supplementary material, adding interpretations, explanations and perspectives on the edited text, that could be of great value to other scholars. In addition, allowing users to annotate a text also can encourage more attentive reading and engagement (Pearson et al. 2012). Annotations may be used as procedural signals for future attention, placemarkings and aids for memory, in situ working on problems, tracing progress or as interpretations (Marshall 1997). Open annotation of web content allows reviewing and discussion before, during and after publication, as well as fact checking and information extraction (Ruland Staines 2018).” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 178)

“annotation as saying something about (a fragment of) the text and not about (a fragment of) a specific webpage that is part of the edition’s website. But the web browser they use to view the edition only sees that webpage as a block of data containing a combination of text strings wrapped in HTML markup, with CSS information for styling the text and JavaScript code to make it interactive.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 179)
## Tecnologie in uso

[[Digital Annotations in IIIF]]

“The Web Annotation Working Group of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has made the attempt to consolidate the classic concept of human-targeted annotations with a technical model that adds a new layer to the web in order to interlink web resources with human-readable annotations by means of Semantic Web technologies (Ciccarese et al. 2017a, 2017b). These web annotations are based on general linking standards that allow the creation of references to resources of various media types (text, images, videos, etc.) or their respective fragments (e.g. time- or space-based).” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 2)

“First, the user and the tool are ‘thinking’ differently about what the annotation refers to, i.e. the problem anchoring the annotation, and, second, about what kind of thing that referenced part of the edition is and how is related to other parts, i.e. the problem of semantics.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 179)

“An exception is Pundit, which can read underlying resource information from RDFa to use an object identifier as the annotation target instead of the web page URL, but does not interpret or exploit structural information about the object to do semantic reasoning.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 180)

“To keep track of what that comment or tag refers to, the tool stores it in combination with the location of the selected fragment, which is a combination of the URL of the webpage, and a so-called XPath expression that identifies the selected HTML element(s)" -> problematico se la pagina cambia URL o la struttura HTML viene modificata! (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 180)

“The editable domain contains both the abstract Work as conceived and created by Vincent van Gogh and the physical Document as the Manifestation¹¹ of that Work. Each text fragment (Positioned Text Fragment) belongs to both the abstract Work and its Manifestation (it is for instance both part of a paragraph and positioned on a page). The process of editing produces a number of representations, e.g. a Page Image in the form of a digital facsimile representing the Document, a Transcript of the text representing the Positioned Text Fragments and a Reading Text that realises the abstract Work.” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 189)

## Visualizzare l'annotazione

“In the past, annotations for e.g. highlighting, classifying or commenting that were made during the research process remained invisible to the public in most cases. In digital environments they can be made visible again, e.g. through a set of partially combined features such as colours, underlining, clickable links or popup windows. Public visibility contributes to an increased relevance of these traces of scholarly practice by approximating them to analogue structures such as marginalia in ancient books or apparatus critici in printed scholarly editions. At the same time, the visualizations benefit from digitization. Because of the possibilities for switching between numerous levels of annotation in the visualizations, digital infrastructures enable arranging annotations for different purposes and/or from different persons much more transparently than what is possible in analogue environments with more confined storage space” (“Annotations in Scholarly Editions and Research: Functions, Differentiation, Systematization”, 2020, p. 4)
