- **Three different agents** involved in an annotation creation: the body's author (who wrote the content of the annotation itself); the technical agent which enables the annotation; (optional) the editor who decides to change annotation status based on editorial criteria (e.g. draft, published, deprecated etc.) -> makes explicit the **distributed agency** of annotations. This resonates with **Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory**: technical infrastructures are not neutral; they co-shape the act of annotation as much as human authors/editors.
- Annotations may be **personal notes** of a reader or may be **critical notes for others** to read.
- Does the annotation refers to a **part of the text** or to the **text as a whole**? Meronymy.
- Does the annotation have **multiple referents** (of different typologies) inside?
- Is the annotation referring to secondary sources, bibliographic records etc.?
- Working on different graphs? Es. L0, L1, L2, L3 in MIMO, where L0 is factual data. Decide graph boundaries by function (facts vs. claims vs. assessment vs. mining), not by ontology alone.
- Annotation has to be **atomic**; that is, a finite piece of information regarding something: annotations being atomic _but_ dependent on context acknowledges what **Derrida** called the _iterability_ of signs: once moved from one context to another, the annotation is not simply “the same” anymore. Your Warburg example captures this perfectly — annotation has a temporal, situated essence.
- Annotation depends on its **context** and on its liminality (see above): if I write a note about Warburg being the greatest historian of art of the twentieth century, and then I copy/paste this same note into a text (i.e. a intellectual biography of Warburg) I cannot say it is an annotation anymore; BUT I can say it WAS an annotation (see below). Maintaining a distance while acknowledging it. The idea that annotations can _become_ the text (or cease being annotations once integrated) is powerful. This ties into **Genette’s paratexts**: margins, footnotes, glosses are liminal entities that mediate between text and interpretation.
- Annotations are **dynamic**: annotations change state, and they can become the "final" text itself (see above).
- Annotations are different from citations, because citations are functionally stable; they cannot change their functions without losing their ontological status; they depends on their function (citing a passage, a work, a paper etc) and works as conceptual pointers to the body of content itself. Orality is a great example of this: when you quote someone, you either bring into life by voice the precise content of someone words and, in some cases, his or her authoritativeness (e.g. *ipse dixit*). By stressing that citations are functionally stable while annotations are multifunctional, you highlight their ontological difference. Citations are more like indexical signs (Peirce): they point to something in a fixed way. Annotations, by contrast, can oscillate between iconic, indexical, and symbolic functions depending on their context.
- So, annotations are **multifunctional**: and annotations can contain citations.
- Annotations per semantic complexity of its body:

| Modality         | Function                                                                | Levels         | Audience                         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Emphatic         | highlighting, underlining                                               | L0+L1          | Private                          |
| Descriptive      | local interpretation, tagging, metadata, commenting, locally explaining | L0+L1 (+L3)    | If L3 Group, Public else Private |
| Referential      | external explanation, entity linking, knowledge structuring             | L0+L1+L2 (+L3) | If L3 Group, Public else Private |
| Critical         | meta-annotation, expresses agreement/disagreement                       | L0+L1+L2 (+L3) | If L3 Group, Public else Private |
| Publication Info |                                                                         | L3             | Group, Public                    |

### **Possible gaps or refinements**

1. **Annotation as a speech act**:
    
    You are close to seeing annotation as a kind of _speech act_ (Austin, Searle): every annotation is not just content, but a performative move (“highlighting,” “criticizing,” “endorsing”). This could help formalize the **illocutionary force** of annotations (e.g. agreement, contestation, questioning).
    
2. **The ontology of “aboutness”**:
    
    You emphasize whether annotations refer to part or whole, or multiple referents. This is a meronymy problem but also a **phenomenology of intentionality** (Husserl): the act of annotation always intends an object, but that object can shift in granularity and scope. Making explicit that “aboutness” is not a stable one-to-one relation, but a **negotiated horizon**, could be philosophically rich.
    
3. **Dynamic vs. archival tension**:
    
    You stress that annotations change and may become text. But digital infrastructures often freeze annotations into fixed metadata. You might bring in **Paul Ricoeur** on narrative and time: annotations are processes with temporal dynamics, not static entities, and any ontology that models them risks losing their processual nature.
    
4. **Epistemic value of annotations**:
    
    Annotations are not only marginalia; they embody **epistemic stances**. Philosophers of science (e.g. **Ian Hacking** on “representing and intervening”) could help: annotations don’t just represent texts but intervene in how knowledge circulates.

Other points:

•	**Peirce’s infinite semiosis**: annotations as part of the endless chain of interpretation.
•	**Foucault’s archaeology of knowledge**: annotations as traces of interpretive regimes, institutionalized practices of reading and writing.
•	**Simondon’s individuation**: annotations as processes of becoming, not fixed objects — always in transition between personal note, editorial act, or published content.
