## Riassunto:

#### Modelling as a Semiotic Process (p. 63)

Modelling in the Semantic Web borrows a _representational_ paradigm from engineering, where models are conceived as stable and shared representations of a given domain. The assumption is that they are semantically uniform, relying on the same classes and predicates in order to guarantee interoperability. This approach implies a strong commitment to objectivity, as if the ontology could perfectly mirror the domain. From this perspective, the formal models proposed in the Semantic Web can be seen as _naïve_ hermeneutical attempts to explicitly represent and systematize [[Digital Trace]] within a domain.

By contrast, when models are viewed as _signs_ in the Peircean tradition, an ontology acquires meaning only within a hermeneutical tradition, that is, only when situated in a specific context (for instance, an ontology functions differently for a computer scientist, an archivist, or a humanities scholar).

Within a semiotic framework, models act as _hypoicons_: they may take the form of pictures (e.g. a tourist map of a city), diagrams (e.g. a transportation network), or metaphors (e.g. the city as a pulsating heart with arteries), depending on their level of abstraction. These are not rigid categories, but rather positions along a spectrum on which signs can be situated through negotiation among different actors and stakeholders.

This shifts the perspective from ontologies as normative structures that constrain semantics to ontologies as semiotic artefacts that mediate meaning, similarly to Peirce’s notion of infinite semiosis.
