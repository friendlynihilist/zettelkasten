## Riassunto:

p.71-72

Romele proposes two main axes with respect to Digital Hermeneutics: on one hand, we have the distinction between "methodological" and "ontological" DH; on the other, between data- and text-orienteted perspectives.
Methodological DH is an instrumental approach about computer-mediated interpretation of texts or corpora, i.e. the development of computational methodologies to understand texts (e.g. Text Encoding Initiative). The "digital" is somewhat external to the interpretation, which remains a human endeavour; it doesn't change the nature of interpretation, but the methodologies through which it manifests itself.
Ontological DH instead is concerned with the "digital" as a constitutive element of human being-in-the-world and epistemological sense-making. The "digital" becomes a world form, a pre-existing ambient (cf. [[@uexk√ºll2010]]). Moreover, the "digital" co-constitutes the sense of the world, in the tradition of postphenomenology. As such, digital hermeneutics becomes a philosophy of mediation.

p.73

Moreover, DH should be interested in all data, not just texts, because everything becomes traceable (and, therefore, interpretable), in line with Dilthey universal hermeneutics. Digital Hermeneutics "must be rather focused on the sociomateriality, the details of the specific system technology that captured the data".

p.74

In Truth and Method, Gadamer discusses whether human sciences can share the same method with natural sciences. The answer is negative: truth emerges in conjunction with comprehension, and interpretation is always situated in an already signified horizon of comprehension. Truth is embodied, lived and, as such, ontological rather than epistemological. "Hermeneutics must be understood in contraposition to the scientific, methodological and quantitative perspective that reduces truth to the analytic explanation of discrete facts. The truth that emerges from a text cannot be reduced to data, for example. In this sense, however, the opposition between truth and method is a choice: rather we sacrifice a fragment of the reality we study or we abjurate objectivity.
Instead, Ricoeur proposes a route that approaches the truth applying a methodology composed of semiotics and semantics rather than working for sudden existential revelations (like in Heidegger or Gadamer), while ontology ultimately remain the last degree of mediation.

p.75

Notion of "digital trace" which represents the hermeneutic alternative to the concept of semantic information of Floridi. For Floridi ([[@floridi2024]]) information is composed of data + semantics; information is a trustworthy representation of reality, as long as it is well-formatted and semantically correct.

Instead, the notion of "digital trace" signifies the unbridgeable gap between reference and meaning; reality and its digital representation. Digital traces such as metadata, clicks, logs, likes are partial, non-neutral representation. There are no pure data, before the data there's a recorded event, a trace (e.g. my finger which scrolls the mouse wheel in order to overcome pagination limits in a website). Moreover, digital traces are not evident as they are. They need to be organized, selected, parametrised, aggregated, for example through a database, a model or a visualization.
