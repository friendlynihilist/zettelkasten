Fu realizzato nei primi anni del XX secolo nella Russia imperiale, in forma di documento segreto attribuito a una fantomatica cospirazione ebraica e massonica il cui obiettivo sarebbe impadronirsi del mondo. La natura di falso fu appurata gi{\`a} fin dai primi tempi successivi alla pubblicazione di detti Protocolli, avvenuta per la prima volta nel 1903 attraverso un quotidiano di Pavolakij Kru{\v s}evan; la prima stesura del testo venne scritta da Sergej Aleksandrovi{\v c} Nilus tra il 1901 e il 1903, che ne diffuse delle copie personalmente in Russia, fino a che non venne pubblicata da Kru{\v s}evan e inizi{\`o} ad avere risonanza anche nel resto d'Europa. Una serie di articoli pubblicati sul Times di Londra nel 1921 dimostrarono che il contenuto dei documenti era falso; gran parte del materiale era frutto di plagio da precedenti opere di satira politica e romanzi non correlati agli ebrei. Nonostante la comprovata falsit{\`a} dei documenti, riscossero comunque ampio credito in ambienti antisemiti e antisionisti, e rimangono tutt'oggi la base ideologica, soprattutto tra partiti o movimenti islamisti e fondamentalisti islamici in Medio Oriente, per avvalorare la teoria della cosiddetta cospirazione ebraica. I Protocolli sono considerati la prima opera della moderna letteratura complottista. Presentata come un'esposizione di un piano operativo degli "anziani" ai nuovi membri, descrive i metodi per ottenere il dominio del mondo attraverso il controllo dei media e della finanza e la sostituzione dell'ordine sociale tradizionale con un nuovo sistema basato sulla manipolazione delle masse. L'opera fu divulgata per la prima volta da coloro i quali si opponevano al movimento rivoluzionario russo e diffusa ulteriormente dopo la Rivoluzione russa del 1905. In seguito alla Rivoluzione d'ottobre che fece collassare l'Impero russo e in particolare durante gli anni venti e trenta, l'idea che il bolscevismo fosse una cospirazione ebraica per il dominio mondiale divent{\`o} uno degli strumenti pi{\`u} utilizzati nell'ambito della propaganda nazista in Germania, e in questo contesto i Protocolli, frutto di un'invenzione fraudolenta, diventarono il testo di riferimento per giustificare la persecuzione e lo sterminio degli ebrei.Sebbene dopo la seconda guerra mondiale l'uso sistematico dei Protocolli sia diminuito, il testo rimane ancora un'arma propagandistica molto usata, soprattutto in alcuni ambienti del mondo islamico in funzione antisionista; tuttavia il suo uso {\`e} presente anche in altri ambienti: nella Chiesa ortodossa russa e in Giappone, ad esempio, sono un caposaldo della propaganda di frange di estrema destra. In Occidente i Protocolli rimangono un pilastro di varie teorie sul complotto giudaico e del Nuovo Ordine Mondiale, presenti in partiti e movimenti di estrema destra e neofascisti in Europa, Stati Uniti e Russia.},

  abstract = {Henricus Antonius "Han" van Meegeren (Dutch pronunciation: [ɦ{$\varepsilon$}nˈrikʏs ɑnˈtoːnijəs ˈɦɑm vɑn meɪ{$\gamma$}ərə(n)]; 10 October 1889 -- 30 December 1947) was a Dutch painter and portraitist, considered one of the most ingenious art forgers of the 20th century. Van Meegeren became a national hero after World War II when it was revealed that he had sold a forged painting to Reichsmarschall Hermann G{\"o}ring during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands.As a child, Van Meegeren developed an enthusiasm for the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, and he set out to become an artist. Art critics, however, decried his work as tired and derivative, and Van Meegeren felt that they had destroyed his career. He decided to prove his talent by forging paintings by 17th-century artists including Frans Hals, Pieter de Hooch, Gerard ter Borch and Johannes Vermeer. The best art critics and experts of the time accepted the paintings as genuine and sometimes exquisite. His most successful forgery was Supper at Emmaus, created in 1937 while he was living in the south of France; the painting was hailed as a real Vermeer by leading experts of the day such as Dr Abraham Bredius.During World War II, G{\"o}ring traded 137 paintings for one of Van Meegeren's false Vermeers, and it became one of his most prized possessions. Following the war, Van Meegeren was arrested, as officials believed that he had sold Dutch cultural property to the Nazis. Facing a possible death penalty, Van Meegeren confessed to the less serious charge of forgery. He was convicted on falsification and fraud charges on 12 November 1947, after a brief but highly publicised trial, and was sentenced to one year in prison. He did not serve out his sentence however; he died on 30 December 1947 in the Valerius Clinic in Amsterdam, after two heart attacks. A biography in 1967 estimated that Van Meegeren duped buyers out of the equivalent of more than US\$30 million (approximately US\$254 million in 2022); his victims included the government of the Netherlands.},

In particular, we implement and evaluate a transfer learning approach in which contextualized representations learned from discourse parsing tasks are used as input of argument mining models. As a pilot application, we explore the feasibility of using automatically identified argumentative components and relations to predict the acceptance of papers in computer science venues. In order to conduct our experiments, we propose an annotation scheme for argumentative units and relations and use it to enrich an existing corpus with an argumentation layer.}

  abstract = {As digital iconography takes hold in contemporary art history studies and gradually encompasses iconology and disciplines in hermeneutics, the question arises whether existing nomenclatures are suitable for representing different levels of interpretation of the image. One such nomenclature is IconClass, a hierarchical and alphanumeric classification system: we try to understand to what extent it can encode emotional variables that may aid iconological interpretation. In this study, we select a corpus of images from the photographic archive of the Bibliotheca Hertziana, categorized by IconClass terms from Classical mythology. We associated terms from the SenticNet vocabulary to each image, using the keywords that IconClass itself assigns to its categories. We then had the same images annotated by independent, non-expert raters, who were given no information on the scenes being depicted. A comparative study of these two ratings yielded that, although there is less disagreement on the sentiments most commonly associated to tragedy, the variety of emotional content in classical imagery remains largely unexpressed by what is arguably the most widely adopted classification system for visual art.},

The study is motivated by the proven effectiveness of knowledge graphs for interpretable and controllable text generation and exploratory search. Original in our work is that we propose a model of the knowledge encapsulated in arguments. Based on this model, we build a new corpus that comprises about 16k manual annotations of 4740 claims with instances of the model's elements, and we develop an end-to-end framework that automatically identifies all modeled types of instances. The results of experiments show the potential of the framework for building a web-based argumentation graph that is of high quality and large scale.},

Treating cultural works as nodes and influences as directed edges, the visualization of these cultural networks can provide new insights into the rich interconnections of cultural development such as that seen in movie references. All findings reported in this article were made through a process that involved network scientists, a media theorist and a sociologist; the role that visualization can play in bridging scientific communities was central to this work. The visualizations were in fact the result of a process to bring researchers from different disciplines together. While traditionally physicists have used different methods than those used by media theorists or sociologists, physicists are increasingly asking questions similar to those asked by media theorists or sociologists as they study the dynamics in networks. Visualization can serve as a common language that brings fields together and identifies the differences between them but that also has its own idiosyncratic views.},

As RDF data continue to be published across heterogeneous domains and integrated at Web-scale such as in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud, RDF data management systems are being exposed to queries that are far more diverse and workloads that are far more varied. The first contribution of our work is an in-depth experimental analysis that shows existing SPARQL benchmarks are not suitable for testing systems for diverse queries and varied workloads. To address these shortcomings, our second contribution is the Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite (WatDiv) that provides stress testing tools for RDF data management systems. Using WatDiv, we have been able to reveal issues with existing systems that went unnoticed in evaluations using earlier benchmarks. Specifically, our experiments with five popular RDF data management systems show that they cannot deliver good performance uniformly across workloads. For some queries, there can be as much as five orders of magnitude difference between the query execution time of the fastest and the slowest system while the fastest system on one query may unexpectedly time out on another query. By performing a detailed analysis, we pinpoint these problems to specific types of queries and workloads.},

  abstract = {This article offers an overview of current approaches to the study of diagrams and their roles in scientific knowledge-making. The discussion develops in three parts. The first part investigates and questions historical and philosophical analyses of the suppression of diagrams in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It attempts to sketch an alternative historiography of diagrammatic practices, in which the insights of advocates of diagrammatic reasoning in a time of ``objectivity without images'' take center stage. The second part of the article turns to the American philosopher, scientist and logician Charles Sanders Peirce, as a representative defender of diagrammatic reasoning and diagrammatic representation in the late nineteenth century, and investigates his legacy on current approaches to diagrams. The third and final part exposes a puzzling paradox in the literature, characterizing it as a false dichotomy between ``the representational view'' and the ``objectbased view'' of diagrams. The article concludes that this dichotomy reveals more about the identities of scholars embracing particular disciplinary traditions than about diagrams themselves, and suggests that it can be overcome by attending to diagramming as a practice at the intersections of representation, manipulation and experimentation.},

  abstract = {The objective of this project is to apply ``legal design thinking'' and legal visualization techniques in Tax legal studies to facilitate the understanding and access to Tax law and the functioning of its Institutions. Specifically, so that it is more citizen-oriented to cope with idiomatic, formative and cultural barriers. Legal Design Thinking tries to make legal information simpler and clear for the public through the design of communication techniques and visualization (i.e. produce logic diagram visualising the different institutions, their compositions, law issues to be used in administrations). In this line, the work of communication and information designers is organizing and displaying information in a way that maximises its clarity and understandability. It focuses on the needs of the users and the context in which they need to find and apply information. When the content is complex, readers need to grasp both the big picture and the details and often switch between these two views. This is where visualisation -here understood as adding graphs, icons, tables, charts and images to supplement text -enters the picture. Visualisation can help in navigating text, opening its meaning and reinforcing its message, even in the field of law. And information design is not only about visualisation: it is also about many other useful things such as language, readability, typography, layout, colour coding, and white space. This project is developed within the framework of the Jean Monnet Project``Legal Design Thinking and Legal Visualization. Towards an Understandable EU Law (620987-EPP-1-2020-1-ES-EPPJMO-PROJECT).},

  abstract = {The process of designing systems or products largely depends on a number of decisions, like ``who do I design for?'', ``what should my product do?'', ``what are the user requirements?'' etc. The developing teams usually base their decisions on experience and/or heuristics and this is particularly the case, in the development of online products and especially online exhibitions. The different solutions are frequently case studies of specific museums or institutions that wish to provide online content to actual or possible visitors. In addition, the interdisciplinary nature of the endeavor, involving museology, technology but also education, poses important design problems. In the following sections, we present a generic methodology for the design of online exhibitions, using top-down processes and transferable findings across museum types that wish to assist the designers during the early decision stages.},

This article proposes an approach based on machine learning and transfer learning that browses IIIF manuscript pages and detects the illuminated ones. To evaluate our approach, a group of domain experts created a new dataset of manually annotated IIIF manuscripts. The preliminary results show that our algorithm detects the main illuminated pages in a manuscript, thus reducing experts' search time.},

Based on a confrontation between H.-G. Gadamer's and Paul Ricoeur's philosophy, our main goal would be searching for the essence of the source code in language. Thus, a closer look is taken into cultural symbols, natural language, and artificial languages. Especially, there would be discussed the problem of abstraction, linguistic community, self-forgetfulness, vitality of formal languages, and display of individuality. This is where the cultural layer of the code can be traced, hence we may find our world-view verbal in nature. In line with the Critical Code Studies approach, in this article, the source code is treated as text. Because of its complexity, the issue should be studied within philosophical inquiry and computer science knowledge. Hence, the perspective developed here goes back to origins and provides a philosophical foundation for Critical Code Studies thinking. The article presents academics with a philosophical challenge: how to understand the source code with an adaptation of a philosophy rejecting artificiality. With philosophical reflection, the source code gains additional meaning and experiences increase in being. Understanding happens in language, which realizes as discourse.},

For example, digital storytelling is characterized by interactivity, nonlinearity, flexible outcomes, user participation, even co-creation. Such affordances may be disruptive to traditional humanities scholars accustomed to working alone, with physical objects, and following established theoretical guidelines. However, they may be quite appealing to those seeking new opportunities for cross-disciplinary, iterative approaches to practice-based humanities scholarship and pedagogy. This essay defines digital storytelling as a combination of storytelling techniques, digital affordances, and humanities foci, describes several forms of digital storytelling, outlines frameworks and outcomes associated with their use, and promotes digital storytelling as providing new opportunities for humanities scholarship and teaching, especially with regard to critical thinking, communication, digital literacy, and civic engagement.},

It assumes that the reflection on annotations furthers our insight into methods and functions of close reading, while, at the same time, also considering the functions of annotations in teaching. One of its major claims concerns the relevance of annotations to a text as a whole as well as the passage it immediately refers to. By positing a number of provocative examples and hypotheses it invites the critical debate on all matters related to annotations and their connotations.},

However, evaluating this kind of work is difficult; it is not clear what good or bad design fiction is or what the judgment criteria should be. In this paper we assert that design fiction is a heterogeneous set of methods, and practices, able to produce a diversity of scholarly and design contributions. We argue locating these diverse practices under the single header of ``design fiction'' has resulted in epistemological confusion over the appropriate method of evaluation. We identify different traditions within the HCI literature---critical design; narratology and literary theory; studio-based design ``crits''; user studies; scenarios and persona development; and thought experiments---to articulate a typology of evaluative frames. There is often a mismatch between the standards to which design fiction is held and the knowledge that speculative methods seek to produce. We argue that evaluating a given instance of design fiction requires us to properly select the right epistemological tool for the job.},

Fuelled by critical voices among the DH community, DH scholars are becoming more aware of the intrinsic advantages that incorporating the notion of uncertainty into their workflows may bring. Additionally, the increasing availability of ubiquitous, web-based technologies has given rise to many collaborative tools that aim to support DH scholars in performing remote work alongside distant peers from other parts of the world. In this context, this paper describes two user studies seeking to evaluate a taxonomy of textual uncertainty aimed at enabling remote collaborations on digital humanities (DH) research objects in a digital medium. Our study focuses on the task of free annotation of uncertainty in texts in two different scenarios, seeking to establish the requirements of the underlying data and uncertainty models that would be needed to implement a hypothetical collaborative annotation system (CAS) that uses information visualisation and visual analytics techniques to leverage the cognitive effort implied by these tasks. To identify user needs and other requirements, we held two user-driven design experiences with DH experts and lay users, focusing on the annotation of uncertainty in historical recipes and literary texts. The lessons learned from these experiments are gathered in a series of insights and observations on how these different user groups collaborated to adapt an uncertainty taxonomy to solve the proposed exercises. Furthermore, we extract a series of recommendations and future lines of work that we share with the community in an attempt to establish a common agenda of DH research that focuses on collaboration around the idea of uncertainty.},

During the last decades huge amounts of literature works have been scanned to provide better access to Humanities researchers and teachers. Was the problem 20 years ago one of scarceness of information (precious originals only to consult in major libraries), today's problem is that of information overload: many databases online and many CD collections are available; each with their own search forms and attributes. This makes it cumbersome for users to find relevant information. In this paper, we describe a case study of how Semantic Web Technologies can be used to disclose cultural heritage information in a scalable way. We present an ontology of Humanities, a semi-automatic tool for annotation, and an application to exploit the annotated content. This tool, positioned somewhere in the middle, between a basic editor and a fully automatic wrapper, helps annotators performing heavy knowledge acquisition tasks in a more efficient and secure way.},

One of the main objectives of the URREF ontology is to define and articulate the criteria which enable the systematic reasoning about and evaluation of uncertainty representation and reasoning in information fusion systems. Towards assessing the merits of the URREF, information quality requires close attention for the measuring veracity and relevance. Veracity is measured from source sensitivity. Relevance is determined from precision and recall measures which are added to the URREF ontology. An example based on the Avionics Analytics Ontology (AAO) for Air Traffic Management with multiple Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) radars is provided. The use or the precision-recall, F1 score, and sensitivity provide useful analysis for semantically important discussions on ``relevance'' as a complement of ``recall'' in information fusion uncertainty assessment.},

  abstract = {Knowledge graphs facilitate systematic large-scale data analysis by providing both human and machine-readable structures, which can be shared across different domains and platforms. Nowadays, knowledge graphs can be used to standardise the collection and sharing of user information in many different sectors such as transport, insurance, smart cities and internet of things. Regulations such as the GDPR make sure that users are not taken advantage of when they share data. From a legal standpoint it is necessary to have the user's consent to collect information. This consent is only valid if the user is aware about the information collected at all times. To increase this awareness, we present a knowledge graph visualisation approach, which informs users about the activities linked to their data sharing agreements, especially after they have already given their consent. To visualise the graph, we introduce a user-centred application which showcases sensor data collection and distribution to different data processors. Finally, we present the results of a user study conducted to find out whether this visualisation leads to more legal awareness and trust. We show that with our visualisation tool data sharing consent rates increase from 48\% to 81.5\%.},

Examining the notions of scalability and elasticity in interactive visualizations, we introduce a visualization of personal reading traces such as marginalia or markings inside the reference library of German realist author Theodor Fontane. To explore such a rich and extensive collection, meaningful visual forms of abstraction and detail are as important as the transitions between those states. Following a growing research interest in the role of fluid interactivity and animations between views, we are particularly interested in the potential of carefully designed transitions and consistent representations across scales. The resulting prototype addresses humanistic research questions about the interplay of distant and close reading with visualization research on continuous navigation along several granularity levels, using scrolling as one of the main interaction mechanisms. In addition to presenting the design process and resulting prototype, we present findings from a qualitative evaluation of the tool, which suggest that bridging between distant and close views can enhance exploration, but that transitions between views need to be crafted very carefully to facilitate comprehension.},

Cultural collections can contain thousands of artifacts, of which each typically possesses a diverse set of properties and individual facets constituting a unique relationship to the rest of the collection. Therefore, to create an appropriate representation of the complex data of each underlying artifact, oftentimes, it is not only interesting to get an overview of the entire collection from one perspective, but to explore the specific context of an artifact and the various relations it may have to other items. To investigate the potential of relational perspectives, we selected an art collection as a particularly promising case study. By following and reporting from a collaborative and iterative design process with an art museum, we developed a web interface that contrasts a collection overview with three situated visualizations each exposing a different kind of relational perspective on the art collection from an artifact.},

We suggest science, magic, ambiguity and irony as the cardinal points of design fiction. We then apply these four different approaches to design fiction to the concept of a divorce app for older people. We argue that currently design fiction is dominated by scientistic and ironic design fiction and suggest that magic and ambiguity are currently under explored.},

  abstract = {We propose the philosophical notion of the fold as an evocative vocabulary for the design and critique of interactive data visualizations. An expanding range of application areas, such as digital art history and literary studies, illustrates the potential of data visualization for research and education in the humanities. Coinciding with the increasing currency of data as evidence in the humanities, this research addresses a growing interest in data visualization for visual analysis and argumentation. For example, cultural collection visualizations promise a range of possibilities for visual and interactive representations of digital cultural heritage, used both for free exploration and focused research. Based on the concept of the fold, prominently advanced by Gilles Deleuze, this paper outlines a critical framework that draws attention towards the complexity of the underlying data. The fold offers a way to analyze and conceptualize visualizations through the lens of three integrated operations: explication, implication, and complication. It is an opportunity to think of interactive visualizations as portals into coherent, elastic, and ultimately infinite information spaces. Accordingly, it rejects the separation between interactivity and visual encoding and draws attention to the transitions between multiple states of a visualization. We identify design patterns of the fold in data visualizations, devise a framework for the critical interpretation of interactivity in data visualization, and demonstrate the implications for the digital humanities.},

  abstract = {Uncertainty of late has become an increasingly important and controversial topic in water resource management, and natural resources management in general. Diverse managing goals, changing environmental conditions, conflicting interests, and lack of predictability are some of the characteristics that decision makers have to face. This has resulted in the application and development of strategies such as adaptive management, which proposes flexibility and capability to adapt to unknown conditions as a way of dealing with uncertainties. However, this shift in ideas about managing has not always been accompanied by a general shift in the way uncertainties are understood and handled. To improve this situation, we believe it is necessary to recontextualize uncertainty in a broader way---relative to its role, meaning, and relationship with participants in decision making---because it is from this understanding that problems and solutions emerge. Under this view, solutions do not exclusively consist of eliminating or reducing uncertainty, but of reframing the problems as such so that they convey a different meaning. To this end, we propose a relational approach to uncertainty analysis. Here, we elaborate on this new conceptualization of uncertainty, and indicate some implications of this view for strategies for dealing with uncertainty in water management. We present an example as an illustration of these concepts.},

Scientific articles are published in long coarse-grained text with complicated structures, and they are optimized for human readers and not for automated means of organization and access. Peer reviewing is the main method of quality assessment, but these peer reviews are nowadays rarely published and their own complicated structure and linking to the respective articles are not accessible. In order to address these problems and to better align scientific publishing with the principles of the Web and Linked Data, we propose here an approach to use nanopublications as a unifying model to represent in a semantic way the elements of publications, their assessments, as well as the involved processes, actors, and provenance in general. To evaluate our approach, we present a dataset of 627 nanopublications representing an interlinked network of the elements of articles (such as individual paragraphs) and their reviews (such as individual review comments). Focusing on the specific scenario of editors performing a meta-review, we introduce seven competency questions and show how they can be executed as SPARQL queries. We then present a prototype of a user interface for that scenario that shows different views on the set of review comments provided for a given manuscript, and we show in a user study that editors find the interface useful to answer their competency questions. In summary, we demonstrate that a unified and semantic publication model based on nanopublications can make scientific communication more effective and user-friendly.},

Avoiding distortion and ambiguity is the moral imperative of an upstanding data visualizer.

Should the designer wait to have the exact data, or should he indicate a trend, expressing the hypothetical status of his statement? Can data visualization be designed to express doubt rather than to inform about facts? This essay will deal with the forms of expression of uncertainty in infographics. It will consider the designer as both an observer and a translator, whose position of neutrality is only one of the possible realms of discourse. In general, it will focus on the forms of visual expression of a self-criticizing mood in quantitative research today and it will explore the ways in which data that is not meaningful in statistical terms can become meaningful in semiotic terms.},

  abstract = {To automatically generate accurate and meaningful textual descriptions of images is an ongoing research challenge. Recently, a lot of progress has been made by adopting multimodal deep learning approaches for integrating vision and language. However, the task of developing image captioning models is most commonly addressed using datasets of natural images, while not many contributions have been made in the domain of artwork images. One of the main reasons for that is the lack of large-scale art datasets of adequate image-text pairs. Another reason is the fact that generating accurate descriptions of artwork images is particularly challenging because descriptions of artworks are more complex and can include multiple levels of interpretation. It is therefore also especially difficult to effectively evaluate generated captions of artwork images. The aim of this work is to address some of those challenges by utilizing a large-scale dataset of artwork images annotated with concepts from the Iconclass classification system. Using this dataset, a captioning model is developed by fine-tuning a transformer-based vision-language pretrained model. Due to the complex relations between image and text pairs in the domain of artwork images, the generated captions are evaluated using several quantitative and qualitative approaches. The performance is assessed using standard image captioning metrics and a recently introduced reference-free metric. The quality of the generated captions and the model's capacity to generalize to new data is explored by employing the model to another art dataset to compare the relation between commonly generated captions and the genre of artworks. The overall results suggest that the model can generate meaningful captions that indicate a stronger relevance to the art historical context, particularly in comparison to captions obtained from models trained only on natural image datasets.},

  abstract = {Unifying image understanding and generation has gained growing attention in recent research on multimodal models. Although design choices for image understanding have been extensively studied, the optimal model architecture and training recipe for a unified framework with image generation remain underexplored. Motivated by the strong potential of autoregressive and diffusion models for high-quality generation and scalability, we conduct a comprehensive study of their use in unified multimodal settings, with emphasis on image representations, modeling objectives, and training strategies. Grounded in these investigations, we introduce a novel approach that employs a diffusion transformer to generate semantically rich CLIP image features, in contrast to conventional VAE-based representations. This design yields both higher training efficiency and improved generative quality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a sequential pretraining strategy for unified models-first training on image understanding and subsequently on image generation-offers practical advantages by preserving image understanding capability while developing strong image generation ability. Finally, we carefully curate a high-quality instruction-tuning dataset BLIP3o-60k for image generation by prompting GPT-4o with a diverse set of captions covering various scenes, objects, human gestures, and more. Building on our innovative model design, training recipe, and datasets, we develop BLIP3-o, a suite of state-of-the-art unified multimodal models. BLIP3-o achieves superior performance across most of the popular benchmarks spanning both image understanding and generation tasks. To facilitate future research, we fully open-source our models, including code, model weights, training scripts, and pretraining and instruction tuning datasets.},

Instead, we intend to adapt the model analysis elaborated in visual semiotics in order to identify a set of discrete visual composition criteria upon which to establish the accuracy of the assessments. We will therefore distinguish three fundamental dimensions -plastic categories, multimodal translation, and enunciation- each articulated in multiple specific sub-criteria. We will then test these criteria on Midjourney and DALL{$\cdot$}E while providing the abstract structure of the prompts in order to allow them to be used in future quantitative analyses.},

Guidelines and standards to formally represent disciplinary information are available (e.g. XML schemas, ontologies, vocabularies). However, digital artefacts rarely address reusable structured information on the hermeneutical approach adopted by scholars when validating hypotheses. As a consequence, reproducibility and assessment of research results is hampered, and comparing online contradictory information is still a hard task. In this work we show how to leverage Semantic Web technologies in a high-level, portable data model for representing hermeneutical aspects related to cross-disciplinary analysis of archival and literary sources. We showcase three representative scenarios in the Cultural Heritage domain where the model is applied, and we describe benefits and limits of our solution.},

Here, we present the use of bespoke, interactive data graphics (bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) for visual exploration of a knowledge graph. By modeling a chart as a set of metadata that describes semantic context (SPARQL query) separately from visual context (Vega-Lite specification), we leverage the high-level, declarative nature of the SPARQL and Vega-Lite grammars to concisely specify web-based, interactive data graphics synchronized to a knowledge graph. Resources with dereferenceable URIs (uniform resource identifiers) can employ the hyperlink encoding channel or image marks in Vega-Lite to amplify the information content of a given data graphic, and published charts populate a browsable gallery of the database. We discuss design considerations that arise in relation to portability, persistence, and performance. Altogether, this pairing of SPARQL and Vega-Lite---demonstrated here in the domain of polymer nanocomposite materials science---offers an extensible approach to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) scientific data visualization within a knowledge graph framework.},

The encoding scheme has been defined according to the latest guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative and it has been instantiated on a sample of letters. Contextually, a first environment has been implemented by customizing two open source tools: Edition Visualization Technology and Omega Scholarly platform. The main objective of the digital edition is to engage the general public with the cultural heritage held by the Belliniano Civic Museum of Catania. This wide access to Bellini's correspondence has been conceived preserving the scholarly transcriptions of the letters edited by Seminara within her recent critical edition ([3]). The digital edition of the corpus takes care of handling the correspondence metadata by means of the correspDesc TEI tagset. Finally, Bellini's letters will be accessible via the Web platform as well as integrated into a forthcoming interactive and multimedia tour hosted at the museum.},

Most of these studies concluded that cultural differences really affect UX. These studies were conducted in different countries, using different methods and led by researches with different cultures. Observing these points, the main objective of this review is to map the work in this area and to suggest a research guideline for similar work. First, a systematic literature review was conducted in the main academic search engines, using many related keywords. The search engines returned 1227 studies and all abstracts were read and evaluated according to the acceptance criteria. Twenty three remaining studies were analyzed in detail. Results showed that the Hofstede's definition of culture and cultural differences is the most commonly used definition in this area, most studies used questionnaires to evaluate if the culture really influences UX and regarding the results, the majority, 87 \%, confirm that it does. Based on this analysis, we identify and propose a guideline to replicate this kind of work in other scenarios. This guideline may represent a significant contribution to the area, perhaps enabling an increase in the number and standardization of certain cross-cultural studies, in the development of new techniques and in the relevance of this subject during UX projects.},

However, it is the often comprehensive and complex nature of collections that can make it difficult to grasp their distribution and extent across a variety of dimensions. After a brief introduction to the research area of collection visualizations, this paper presents a design study visualizing an aggregated collection from diverse cultural institutions in Germany. We detail our iterative design process leading to prototypical implementations of four stylistically and functionally coordinated visualizations, each one focusing on different facets of the collection.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the challenge of processing and extracting information from large quantities of printed serial sources from the 19th century, which have been largely untapped due to the inadequacies of existing extraction techniques. We focus on the Habsburg Central Europe's Hof- und Staatsschematismus, a comprehensive record published between 1702 and 1918 that documents the Habsburg civil service's hierarchy and the evolution of its central administration over two centuries. Our approach sees the significant investment into machine learning-driven layout detection prior to the OCR-process. We generated synthetic data mimicking the Hof- und Staatsschematismus style for initial training of a Faster R-CNN model, followed by fine-tuning the model with a smaller dataset of manually annotated historical documents. Subsequently, we optimised Tesseract-OCR for our document style to enhance the combined structure extraction and OCR process. Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in OCR performance metrics (WER and CER), with the combined structure detection and fine-tuned OCR process showing a decrease in error rates of 15.68 percentage points for CER and 19.95 percentage points for WER. These findings underscore the potential of ML techniques in facilitating the extraction and analysis of historical documents.},

This paper introduces Akin, a UI wireframe generator that allows designers to chose a UI design pattern and provides them with multiple UI wireframes for a given UI design pattern. Akin uses a fine-tuned Self-Attention Generative Adversarial Network trained with 500 UI wireframes of 5 android UI design patterns. Upon evaluation, Akin's generative model provides an Inception Score of 1.63 (SD=0.34) and Fr{\'e}chet Inception Distance of 297.19. We further conducted user studies with 15 UI/UX designers to evaluate the quality of Akin-generated UI wireframes. The results show that UI/UX designers considered wireframes generated by Akin are as good as wireframes made by designers. Moreover, designers identified Akin-generated wireframes as designer-made 50\% of the time. This paper provides a baseline for further research in UI wireframe generation by providing a baseline metric.},

  abstract = {The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly altered the course of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs).These sophisticated models play a crucial role in addressing complex tasks like generating captions for images and responding to visual questions. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs. This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.},

Nevertheless, they are still not widely used by scientists outside specific circles; they are hard to find and rarely cited. We believe this is due to the lack of services to seek, find and understand nanopublications' content. To this end, we present the NanoWeb application to seamlessly search, access, explore, and re-use the nanopublications publicly available on the Web. For the time being, NanoWeb focuses on the life science domain where the vastest amount of nanopublications are available. It is a unified access point to the world of nanopublications enabling search over graph data, direct connections to evidence papers, and scientific curated databases, and visual and intuitive exploration of the relation network created by the encoded scientific facts.},

Annotating RDF data with additional information, such as provenance, trustworthiness, or temporal validity is becoming more and more important in recent times; however, it is possible to natively represent only binary (or dyadic) relations between entities in RDF and OWL. While there are some approaches to represent metadata on RDF, they lose most of the reasoning power of OWL. In this paper we present an extension of Welty and Fikes' 4dFluents ontology---on associating temporal validity to statements---to any number of dimensions, provide guidelines and design patterns to implement it on actual data, and compare its reasoning power with alternative representations.},

  abstract = {Knowledge representation is a central issue for Artificial Intelligence and the Semantic Web. In particular, the problem of representing n-ary relations in RDF-based languages such as RDFS or OWL by no means is an obvious one. With respect to previous attempts, we show why the solutions proposed by the well known W3C Working Group Note on n-ary relations are not satisfactory on several scores. We then present our abstract model for representing n-ary relations as directed labeled graphs, and we show how this model gives rise to a new ontological pattern (parametric pattern) for the representation of such relations in the Semantic Web. To this end, we define PROL (Parametric Relational Ontology Language). PROL is an ontological language designed to express any n-ary fact as a parametric pattern, which turns out to be a special RDF graph. The vocabulary of PROL is defined by a simple RDFS ontology. We argue that the parametric pattern may be particularly beneficial in the context of the Semantic Web, in virtue of its high expressive power, technical simplicity, and faithful meaning rendition. Examples are also provided.}

  abstract = {Interpretation is widely regarded as the core activity of literary studies. Still, the appropriate balance between the plurality and the limitation of possible interpretations is a non-trivial issue. Whereas it is sensible to accept that literary texts can generally have various meanings, it should not be possible to attribute any kind of meaning to a text. Therefore, while interpreters must be allowed to disagree in their analyses, it must at the same time be possible to review whether a disagreement is actually based on adequate reasons like, for example, textual ambiguity or polyvalence.             In this paper, we propose a best practice model as one effective means to review disagreement in accordance with literary studies principles. The model has been developed during the collaborative, computer-assisted annotation of literary texts in a project in which short stories have been analyzed narratologically. The examination of inconsistently annotated text passages revealed four types of reasons for disagreement: misinterpretations, deficient definitions of the categories of analysis, dependencies of the relevant categories on preliminary analyses, and textual ambiguity/polyvalence. We argue that only disagreements based on textual ambiguity are considered legitimate or valuable cases of disagreement, whereas the other three types of disagreement can be resolved in a systematic way.},

Secondly, we want to encourage critical approaches towards the representation of cultural production and allow for alternative or even conflicting narratives and interpretations to surface. We present related work, use cases, and concepts for visualisations and interfaces that invite the reconsideration of modes of categorisation, presentation and clustering. Our intent is to develop ways to scrutinise modes of exclusion, carry out critical evaluations and pursue interventional strategies. We discuss the specific potential of visualisation, annotation and dynamic expansion of digital cultural collections. Building on critical approaches in human-computer interaction, visualisation and cultural theories, we explore how the interface could be a means of reflection, critique and inclusion.},

With regards to the specific character of cultural heritage at the intersection of research, education, and public interest, the presented visualization environment aims at meeting the requirements of both researchers as well as a broader public. We present the results from a collaborative interdisciplinary research project that involved a cultural heritage foundation, art historians, designers, and computer scientists. The case study examines the potential of visualization when applied to, and developed for, cultural heritage collections. It specifically explores how techniques aimed at visualizing the quantitative structure of a collection can be coupled with a more qualitative mode that allows for detailed examination of the artifacts and their contexts by displaying high-resolution views of digitized cultural objects with detailed art historical research findings. Making use of latest web technologies, the resulting visualization environment allows for dynamic filtering and zooming of a collection of visual resources that are arranged along a contextualized timeline. We share insights from our collaborative design process and the feedback and usage data gathered during the deployment of the resulting prototype as a web application. We end with a discussion of transferability of carefully crafted and collaboratively negotiated visualizations of cultural heritage and raise questions concerning the applicability of our approach to related strands of humanities research.},

The model applies proof standards to determine the acceptability of statements on an issue-by-issue basis. The model uses different types of premises (ordinary premises, assumptions and exceptions) and information about the dialectical status of statements (stated, questioned, accepted or rejected) to allow the burden of proof to be allocated to the proponent or the respondent, as appropriate, for each premise separately. Our approach allows the burden of proof for a premise to be assigned to a different party than the one who has the burden of proving the conclusion of the argument, and also to change the burden of proof or applicable proof standard as the dialogue progresses from stage to stage. Useful for modeling legal dialogues, the burden of production and burden of persuasion can be handled separately, with a different responsible party and applicable proof standard for each. Carneades enables critical questions of argumentation schemes to be modeled as additional premises, using premise types to capture the varying effect on the burden of proof of different kinds of questions.},

This article compares the role of scholar-builders in crystallizing a set of theoretical concerns, data, and analyses to that of the architects of opera houses during the golden age of European opera, who structured, illuminated, and constrained possible future creations of art. The article next attempts to excavate a set of implicit values, while making room for the possibility that the list of values put forward here is only incomplete, and that the list of values itself is the subject of potential debate, critique, or dissent, some of which may take the form of building infrastructures differently than the patterns laid out here. A first section outlines a set of bibliographic values; while the article's second half turns to the power dynamics of infrastructure and a set of critical values encompassed by particular projects, before turning to the issue of why understanding these values is so essential to understanding infrastructure projects as a form of scholarly production that merit support and recognition by the community at large.},

We utilized a "break-fix" cycle, performing multiple rounds of dataset curation, safety post-training, benchmarking, red teaming, and vulnerability identification to cover a variety of harm areas in both single and multi-turn scenarios. Our results indicate that this approach iteratively improved the performance of the Phi-3 models across a wide range of responsible AI benchmarks.

One of the great advantages of the proposed approach is that it clarifies a means to (i) understand sparse matrices, the property graph model, hypergraphs, and other data structures with an emphasis on link attributes, (ii) map such data onto RDF, and (iii) query such data using SPARQL. Further, the proposal greatly expands both the freedom that database designers enjoy when creating physical indexing schemes and query plans for graph data annotated with link attributes and the interoperability of those database solutions.},

This is in contrast to the reference-free manner in which humans assess caption quality. In this paper, we report the surprising empirical finding that CLIP (Radford et al., 2021), a cross-modal model pretrained on 400M image+caption pairs from the web, can be used for robust automatic evaluation of image captioning without the need for references. Experiments spanning several corpora demonstrate that our new reference-free metric, CLIPScore, achieves the highest correlation with human judgements, outperforming existing reference-based metrics like CIDEr and SPICE. Information gain experiments demonstrate that CLIPScore, with its tight focus on image-text compatibility, is complementary to existing reference-based metrics that emphasize text-text similarities. Thus, we also present a reference-augmented version, RefCLIPScore, which achieves even higher correlation. Beyond literal description tasks, several case studies reveal domains where CLIPScore performs well (clip-art images, alt-text rating), but also where it is relatively weaker in comparison to reference-based metrics, e.g., news captions that require richer contextual knowledge.},

In this work, towards a more versatile copilot for academic paper writing, we mainly focus on strengthening the multi-modal diagram analysis ability of Multimodal LLMs. By parsing Latex source files of academic papers, we carefully build a multi-modal diagram understanding dataset M-Paper. By aligning diagrams in the paper with related paragraphs, we construct professional diagram analysis samples for training and evaluation. M-Paper is the first dataset to support joint comprehension of multiple scientific diagrams, including figures and tables in the format of images or Latex codes.

We demonstrate visualization rhetoric as an analytical framework for understanding how design techniques that prioritize particular interpretations in visualizations that ``tell a story'' can significantly affect end-user interpretation. We draw a parallel between narrative visualization interpretation and evidence from framing studies in political messaging, decision-making, and literary studies. Devices for understanding the rhetorical nature of narrative information visualizations are presented, informed by the rigorous application of concepts from critical theory, semiotics, journalism, and political theory. We draw attention to how design tactics represent additions or omissions of information at various levels---the data, visual representation, textual annotations, and interactivity---and how visualizations denote and connote phenomena with reference to unstated viewing conventions and codes. Classes of rhetorical techniques identified via a systematic analysis of recent narrative visualizations are presented, and characterized according to their rhetorical contribution to the visualization. We describe how designers and researchers can benefit from the potentially positive aspects of visualization rhetoric in designing engaging, layered narrative visualizations and how our framework can shed light on how a visualization design prioritizes specific interpretations. We identify areas where future inquiry into visualization rhetoric can improve understanding of visualization interpretation.},

  abstract = {Understanding and accounting for uncertainty is critical to effectively reasoning about visualized data. However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.},

I contribute a detailed characterization of practices, associations, and attitudes related to uncertainty communication among visualization authors, derived from the results of surveying 90 authors who regularly create visualizations for others as part of their work, and interviewing thirteen influential visualization designers. My results highlight challenges that authors face and expose assumptions and inconsistencies in beliefs about the role of uncertainty in visualization. In particular, a clear contradiction arises between authors' acknowledgment of the value of depicting uncertainty and the norm of omitting direct depiction of uncertainty. To help explain this contradiction, I present a rhetorical model of uncertainty omission in visualization-based communication. I also adapt a formal statistical model of how viewers judge the strength of a signal in a visualization to visualization-based communication, to argue that uncertainty communication necessarily reduces degrees of freedom in viewers' statistical inferences. I conclude with recommendations for how visualization research on uncertainty communication could better serve practitioners' current needs and values while deepening understanding of assumptions that reinforce uncertainty omission.},

  abstract = {Background Understanding artificial intelligence (AI) and contemplating its effects present substantial challenges. A powerful approach to tackling this issue is speculative design (SD), which greatly involves constructing narratives that mobilize discussion on the design and social adoption of technologies. However, research on SD narratives in the context of AI has been scarce. Therefore, this study aims to identify narrative themes in SD that concern human-AI interaction. Methods To begin with, 22 related research cases were collected from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital library based on selection criteria. Subsequently, a constant comparative method was employed to analyze the selected research cases, which resulted in 16 narratives. Thereafter, affinity diagramming was conducted to form higher-order categories, resulting in identifying five narrative themes. Results The analysis yielded five narrative themes: 1) AI Revealing its Ways of Learning, 2) Exposing the Creator of AI, 3) Staging Conflict among Users, 4) Situating Users as Hackers, and 5) Betrayal of AI. All five narrative themes were found to create a discursive space about human-AI interaction and to generate design insights that concern the socio-technical issues of AI. Conclusions The findings of this study add understanding to the growing field of critical thinking in human-computer interaction (HCI) research. They provide insights into developing more readyto-use methodological devices that can stimulate discourse around human experience of AI. It is expected that scholars and practitioners alike may use the findings of this study to apply an SD approach for investigating human-AI interaction.},

This paper presents an adaptive componentbased approach together with its open source implementation for creating flexible and reusable SW interfaces driven by Linked Data. Linked Datadriven (LD-R) Web components abstract the complexity of the underlying SW technologies in order to allow reuse of existing Web components in LDAs, enabling Web developers who are not experts in SW to develop interfaces that view, edit and browse Linked Data. In addition to the modularity provided by the LD-R components, the proposed RDF-based configuration method allows application assemblers to reshape their user interface for different use cases, by either reusing existing shared configurations or by creating their proprietary configurations.},

  abstract = {The digitization of historical manuscripts has significantly advanced in recent decades, yet many documents remain as images without machine-readable text. Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) has emerged as a crucial tool for converting these images into text, facilitating large-scale analysis of historical collections. In 2024, the CATMuS Medieval dataset was released, featuring extensive diachronic coverage and a variety of languages and script types. Previous research indicated that model performance degraded on the best manuscripts over time as more data was incorporated, likely due to overgeneralization. This paper investigates the impact of incorporating contextual metadata in training HTR models using the CATMuS Medieval dataset to mitigate this effect. Our experiments compare the performance of various model architectures, focusing on Conformer models with and without contextual inputs, as well as Conformer models trained with auxiliary classification tasks. Results indicate that Conformer models utilizing semantic contextual tokens (Century, Script, Language) outperform baseline models, particularly on challenging manuscripts. The study underscores the importance of metadata in enhancing model accuracy and robustness across diverse historical texts.},

Since data visualization is based on epistemological premises stemming from the sciences, it is not well-equipped to meet hermeneutic demands. We discuss four postulates that can be used as guidelines and help transform traditional data visualization into hermeneutic visualization, while respecting the epistemological foundations of hermeneutic theory.

Thus, CH organisations need to carefully explore the potential of investing in UX, as visitor satisfaction and intention to return and spread positive word-of-mouth is closely linked to the destination's overall success. A multitude of methods for UX analysis exist, but a clear overview of the current state of the available UX research methods in CH is missing. Recent studies [Othman 2012; Roussou 2018] have successfully developed frameworks to measure UX in cultural spaces, but most of them still lack understanding about how visitors interact with new technologies and simultaneously with the exhibits. In this article, a survey that describes the conceptual frameworks, models, research methodologies, and paradigms of incorporating Cultural User eXperience (CUX) in applications is reported, as well as the overall interaction between UX and CH and the related aspects that are influenced by the CH application domain and the parameters leading to optimization of the CUX. The outcome of this survey lays ground for understanding and defining the concept of UX research in CH, while current challenges and issues for future work are discussed.},

  abstract = {Information visualization (infovis) is a powerful tool for exploring rich datasets. Within humanistic research, rich qualitative data and domain culture make traditional infovis approaches appear reductive and disconnected, leading to low adoption. In this paper, we use a multi-step approach to scrutinize the relationship between infovis and the humanities and suggest new directions for it. We first look into infovis from the humanistic perspective by exploring the humanistic literature around infovis. We validate and expand those findings though a co-design workshop with humanist and infovis experts. Then, we translate our findings into guidelines for designers and conduct a design critique exercise to explore their effect on the perception of humanist researchers. Based on these steps, we introduce Layers of Meaning, a framework to reduce the semantic distance between humanist researchers and visualizations of their research material, by grounding infovis tools in time and space, physicality, terminology, nuance, and provenance.},

Against the backdrop of the recent discussion in the philosophy of science about what models are and what they do, this paper presents a semiotic perspective on models in the framework of Charles S. Peirce's theory of signs that sheds light on the practice of modeling in the digital humanities. As a first step, it is argued that models are icons, i.e. signs that represent their specific objects by being regarded as similar to them; and that there are, in all, three basic types of model, namely ``images,'' ``diagrams,'' and ``metaphors.'' A second step explicates relevant implications of this model-theoretic approach, especially as they relate to the digital humanities. In particular, it is shown that models are not identical to the things they represent and that they only represent them partially; that the representation operates on the basis of a mapping relation between select properties of the model and its object; that each model and each instance of modeling has a theoretical framework; and that models are the true basis for genuine creativity and progress in research.},

While recent Transformer based models have achieved relatively strong performance, they rely heavily on manually transcribed training data and have difficulty generalizing across writers. Multimodal LLM, such as GPT-4v and Gemini, have demonstrated effectiveness in performing OCR and computer vision tasks with few shot prompting. In this paper, I evaluate the accuracy of handwritten document transcriptions generated by Gemini against the current state of the art Transformer based methods.},

  abstract = {Visual Language Models (VLMs) like GPT-4V have broadened the scope of LLM applications, yet they face significant challenges in accurately processing visual details, particularly in scientific diagrams. This paper explores the necessity of meticulous visual detail collection and region decomposition for enhancing the performance of VLMs in scientific diagram analysis. We propose a novel approach that combines traditional computer vision techniques with VLMs to systematically decompose diagrams into discernible visual elements and aggregate essential metadata. Our method employs techniques in OpenCV library to identify and label regions, followed by a refinement process using shape detection and region merging algorithms, which are particularly suited to the structured nature of scientific diagrams. This strategy not only improves the granularity and accuracy of visual information processing but also extends the capabilities of VLMs beyond their current limitations. We validate our approach through a series of experiments that demonstrate enhanced performance in diagram analysis tasks, setting a new standard for integrating visual and language processing in a multimodal context.},

He wrote more than 300 letters, most of which are owned by the Historical Archives of the Pontifical Gregorian University (APUG) in Rome.

To understand the revolutionary nature of Walton's work on this subject matter, it is necessary to place it in the debate that it continues and contributes to, namely a view of logic that is much broader than the formalistic perspective that has been adopted from the 20th century until nowadays. With his book Argumentation schemes for presumptive reasoning, Walton attempted to start a dialogue between three different fields or views on human reasoning -- one (argumentation theory) very recent, one (dialectics) very ancient and with a very long tradition, and one (formal logic) relatively recent, but dominating in philosophy. Argumentation schemes were proposed as dialectical instruments, in the sense that they represented arguments not only as formal relations, but also as pragmatic inferences, as they at the same time depend on what the interlocutors share and accept in a given dialogical circumstance, and affect their dialogical relation. In this introduction, the notion of argumentation scheme will be analyzed in detail, showing its different dimensions and its defining features which make them an extremely useful instrument in Artificial Intelligence. This theoretical background will be followed by a literature review on the uses of the schemes in computing, aimed at identifying the most important areas and trends, the most promising proposals, and the directions of future research.},

We argue that a perspective supported by semiotic and cognitively oriented discourse analyses offers both theoretical insights and motivates representational requirements for the semantics of tools for contesting meaning. We introduce our semiotic approach, highlighting its implications for discourse representation, before describing a research system (ClaiMaker) designed to support the construction of scholarly argumentation by allowing analysts to publish and contest `claims' about scientific contributions. We show how ClaiMaker's representational scheme is grounded in specific assumptions concerning the nature of explicit modelling, and the evolution of meaning within a discourse community. These characteristics allow the system to represent scholarly discourse as a dynamic process, in the form of continuously evolving structures. A cognitively oriented discourse analysis then shows how the use of a small set of cognitive relational primitives in the underlying ontology opens possibilities for offering users advanced forms of computational service for analysing collectively constructed argumentation networks.},

Also, software systems for digital humanities should acknowledge that imprecise and uncertain information exists, but current software development technologies fall short of providing satisfactory approaches to implementing such ``soft'' issues.},

  abstract = {Research in digital humanities involves the need for conscious and explicit handling of data uncertainty. Recently, some initiatives have highlighted the importance of considering this uncertainty from the conceptual model to the final phases of implementation of software tools. Although the conceptual proposals for handling data uncertainty in the humanities have proliferated successfully, there is still a gap in bringing these proposals to actual implementations of software systems, especially due to the need to quantify this uncertainty and adopt more analytical paradigms based on margins of error, away from the conceptualization of data in the humanities. Trying to close this gap and avoid these paradigms, this paper presents a framework based on fuzzy logic that implements aspects of epistemic uncertainty (uncertainty related to our knowledge about the object of study) in digital humanities, providing algebraic and computational support to implementation. The framework proposes a solution to implement software systems that manage epistemic uncertainty, allowing comparisons, aggregations or reasoning with various levels of uncertainty in humanistic data. The solution is implemented in a real digital humanities project, illustrating its possibilities.},

Most techniques used to represent data vagueness emerged from natural sciences, and lack the expressiveness that would be ideal for humanistic contexts. Building on previous work, we present here a conceptual framework based on the ConML modelling language for the expression of information vagueness in digital humanities. In addition, we propose an implementation on non-relational data stores, which are becoming popular within the digital humanities. Having clear implementation guidelines allow us to employ search engines or big data systems (commonly implemented using non-relational approaches) to handle the vague aspects of information. The proposed implementation guidelines have been validated in practice, and show how we can query a vagueness-aware system without a large penalty in analytical and processing power.},

The HBA 1.0 dataset contains 2,435 and 2,001 printed and manuscript pages, respectively. The ground truth of the HBA 1.0 dataset contains more than 7.58 billion annotated pixels. The HBA 1.0 dataset addresses a thriving topic of major interest of many researchers in di erent fields including (historical) document image analysis, image processing, pattern recognition and classification. The HBA 1.0 dataset and its ground truth can be used to evaluate the capabilities of image analysis methods to discriminate the textual content from the graphical ones on the one hand, and to separate the textual content according to di erent text fonts (e.g. lowercase, uppercase, italic) on the other hand.

What treatments do exist mostly focus on practical aspects about the quality and style of annotation. This essay analyses some of the theoretical assumptions that underlie annotational practices with specific reference to the editing of modernist works. It puts into question, first of all, some common perceptions about annotation, which is sometimes viewed as interfering with the readerly experience, to address the matter of the reader: what kind of reader are annotations for? Because annotations are a contextual and hermeneutic device to bridge the gap between the literary work that has come to us from the past and the reader's present, not all readers are served by a single style of annotation. Conversely, to accept this hermeneutic value also means that annotation is never neutral or objective; while editorial practices tend to avoid open interpretive annotation, annotations nonetheless direct the process of reading and interpretation. Annotation thus participates in the sense-making process and, like all other editorial interventions, it represents an act of mediation.},

  abstract = {Iconography in art is the discipline that studies the visual content of artworks to determine their motifs and themes and to characterize the way these are represented. It is a subject of active research for a variety of purposes, including the interpretation of meaning, the investigation of the origin and diffusion in time and space of representations, and the study of influences across artists and artworks. With the proliferation of digital archives of art images, the possibility arises of applying Computer Vision techniques to the analysis of art images at an unprecedented scale, which may support iconography research and education. In this article, we introduce a novel paintings dataset for iconography classification and present the quantitative and qualitative results of applying a               Convolutional Neural Network               (               CNN               ) classifier to the recognition of the iconography of artworks. The proposed classifier achieves good performances (71.17\% Precision, 70.89\% Recall, 70.25\% F1-Score, and 72.73\% Average Precision) in the task of identifying saints in Christian religious paintings, a task made difficult by the presence of classes with very similar visual features. Qualitative analysis of the results shows that the CNN focuses on the traditional iconic motifs that characterize the representation of each saint and exploits such hints to attain correct identification. The ultimate goal of our work is to enable the automatic extraction, decomposition, and comparison of iconography elements to support iconographic studies and automatic artwork annotation.},

In addition to character recognition, which has long been the main application field, these new resources have allowed the adoption of machine learning to detect decoration and miniatures that usually concern only a few pages of a codex but attract great attention especially from non-academic public. The paper presents ongoing research that aims to demonstrate the possible adoption of transfer learning for digitized artworks to improve a pretrained deep neural network ability to recognize handwritten pages, identify the layout elements and, specifically, figurative miniatures in Renaissance manuscripts to be used for the creation of an immersive interface for consulting and comparing images based on their iconography. After a brief introduction to contextualize the changes brought by the massive cultural heritage digitization, we will present some of the most interesting research conducted on both manuscripts and artworks. Next, the dataset built to train the model will be described, focusing on its composition and the image classification system adopted. In conclusion, we will then expose the training strategy chosen to minimize human effort by dividing the dataset into three groups before concluding with the first results obtained so far and the prospects for future development.},

In this approach, one singleton property is created to uniquely represent a relationship in a particular context, and in general, generates a large property hierarchy in the schema. It has become the subject of important questions from Semantic Web practitioners. Can an existing reasoner recognize the singleton property triples? And how? If the singleton property triples describe a data triple, then how can a reasoner infer this data triple from the singleton property triples? Or would the large property hierarchy affect the reasoners in some way? We address these questions in this paper and present our study about the reasoning aspects of the singleton properties. We propose a simple mechanism to enable existing reasoners to recognize the singleton property triples, as well as to infer the data triples described by the singleton property triples. We evaluate the effect of the singleton property triples in the reasoning processes by comparing the performance on RDF datasets with and without singleton properties. Our evaluation uses as benchmark the LUBM datasets and the LUBM-SP datasets derived from LUBM with temporal information added through singleton properties.},

Among the difficulties faced by these systems is the problem of overwhelming the user with a vast amount of data, often referred to as information overload. The problem has escalated with the ever increasing issues of time constraints and the extensive use of handheld devices. The use of context is one possible way out helping with this situation. To provide a more robust approach to context gathering we propose the use of Social Web technologies alongside the Semantic Web. As the social web is heavily used it could provide a better understanding of a user's interests and intentions. The proposed system gathers information about users from their social web identities and enriches it with ontological knowledge. Thus an interest model for the user can be created which can serve as a good source of contextual knowledge. This work bridges the gap between the user and system searches by analyzing the virtual existence of a user and making interesting recommendations accordingly.},

  abstract = {This paper is a survey of standards being used in the domain of digital cultural heritage with focus on the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) created by the Library of Congress in the United States of America. The process of digitization of cultural heritage requires silo breaking in a number of areas---one area is that of academic disciplines to enable the performance of rich interdisciplinary work. This lays the foundation for the emancipation of the second form of silo which are the silos of knowledge, both traditional and born digital, held in individual institutions, such as galleries, libraries, archives and museums. Disciplinary silo breaking is the key to unlocking these institutional knowledge silos. Interdisciplinary teams, such as developers and librarians, work together to make the data accessible as open data on the ``semantic web''. Description logic is the area of mathematics which underpins many ontology building applications today. Creating these ontologies requires a human--machine symbiosis. Currently in the cultural heritage domain, the institutions' role is that of provider of this open data to the national aggregator which in turn can make the data available to the trans-European aggregator known as Europeana. Current ingests to the aggregators are in the form of machine readable cataloguing metadata which is limited in the richness it provides to disparate object descriptions. METS can provide this richness.},

  author = {Oldman, Dominic and Tanase, Diana and Santschi, Stephanie},
  abstract = {Technology is used to compress time and space but at the cost of `nearness'. This means it maintains a distance and disjoint between qualitative and quantitative techniques, and therefore between humanists and technology. The knowledge representations that humanists require to investigate a given subject are not the same as those mandated by technologists and database systems more concerned with scale and the efficiency of data processing and retrieval, rather than context and meaning. This perpetuates a humanist perception of information systems as either, useful but ancillary, or problematic. This paper describes an intervention that seeks to combine the qualitative with the quantitative through collaborative research, expressive structured data, and a human-centered and participatory approach to the `knowledge graph'. Its design is based on an understanding of the history of historical textual narrative and the benefit of approaching quantitative issues from the bottom up, or qualitatively, incorporating different levels of generalisation, perspectives (different vantage point on reality), and approaches to connections across time and space. A specialist question based on the designs of the artist, Katsushika Hokusai is used as a basis to illustrate how `micro' research questions contribute, in part, to bigger questions and higher quality quantitative analysis.},

  abstract = {DBpedia is one of the largest datasets in the linked Open Data cloud. Its centrality and its cross-domain nature makes it one of the most important and most referred to knowledge bases on the Web of Data, generally used as a reference for data interlinking. Yet, in spite of its authoritative aspect, there is no work so far tackling the provenance aspect of DBpedia statements. By being extracted from Wikipedia, an open and collaborative encyclopedia, delivering provenance information about it would help to ensure trustworthiness of its data, a major need for people using DBpedia data for building applications. To overcome this problem, we propose an approach for modelling and managing provenance on DBpedia using Wikipedia edits, and making this information available on the Web of Data.In this paper, we describe the framework that we implemented to do so, consisting in (1) a lightweight modelling solution to semantically represent provenance of both DBpedia resources and Wikipedia content, along with mappings to popular ontologies such as the W7 --what, when, where, how, who, which, and why -- and OPM -- open provenance model -- models, (2) an information extraction process and a provenance-computation system combining Wikipedia articles' history with DBpedia information, (3) a set of scripts to make provenance information about DBpedia statements directly available when browsing this source, as well as being publicly exposed in RDF for letting software agents consume it.}

We encountered this need while being embedded in an academic consortium of four epistemologically-distant scientific teams, who wanted to develop new interdisciplinary hypotheses from their merged datasets. By inviting these scientists to collaboratively develop visualisation prototypes of their data within their own and then towards the other disciplines, we uncovered four data frictions that relate to discipline-specific interpretations of data, methodological approaches, ways of handling data uncertainties, as well as the large differences in dataset scale and granularity. We then recognised how the resulting visualisation prototypes contained several promising techniques that addressed these frictions transparently, such as retaining their overall visualisation context and using visual translators to mediate between differing scales. Driven by critical data discourse that calls for frictions to be foregrounded rather than be occluded, we generalised these techniques into a series of actionable design considerations. While originating from a single case of an interdisciplinary collaboration, we believe that our findings form a crucial step towards enabling a more transparent and accountable interdisciplinary data visualisation practice.},

  abstract = {Due to their historical nature, humanistic data encompass multiple sources of uncertainty. While humanists are accustomed to handling such uncertainty with their established methods, they are cautious of visualizations that appear overly objective and fail to communicate this uncertainty. To design more trustworthy visualizations for humanistic research, therefore, a deeper understanding of its relation to uncertainty is needed. We systematically reviewed 126 publications from digital humanities literature that use visualization as part of their research process, and examined how uncertainty was handled and represented in their visualizations. Crossing these dimensions with the visualization type and use, we identified that uncertainty originated from multiple steps in the research process from the source artifacts to their datafication. We also noted how besides known uncertainty coping strategies, such as excluding data and evaluating its effects, humanists also embraced uncertainty as a separate dimension important to retain. By mapping how the visualizations encoded uncertainty, we identified four approaches that varied in terms of explicitness and customization. This work contributes with two empirical taxonomies of uncertainty and it's corresponding coping strategies, as well as with the foundation of a research agenda for uncertainty visualization in the digital humanities. Our findings further the synergy among humanists and visualization researchers, and ultimately contribute to the development of more trustworthy, uncertainty-aware visualizations.},

We also validated the model through SPARQL queries corresponding to five competency questions to report on satisfiability. Finally, we developed a prototype annotation client as a plugin for Mirador to evaluate its performances in real-world scenarios.

In particular, this study presents the implementation solutions that have emerged during the development of a digital application concerning Vedere l'Invisibile2, an exhibition which follows Lucretius' De rerum natura and its reception in contemporary art. The peculiarity of the exhibition is the presence of heterogeneous data sources such as tangible or intangible cultural items (e.g. paintings, performances) and textual documents (e.g. De rerum natura and its translations). Starting from the aforementioned sources, the work explores modern technological solutions in order to deliver a system that can be both flexible in terms of requirements, reusable and ephemeral.},

  abstract = {Semantic publishing is the use of Web and Semantic Web technologies to enhance the meaning of a published journal article, to facilitate its automated discovery, to enable its linking to semantically related articles, to provide access to data within the article in actionable form, and to facilitate integration of data between articles. Recently, semantic publishing has opened the possibility of a major step forward in the digital publishing world. For this to succeed, new semantic models and visualization tools are required to fully meet the specific needs of authors and publishers. In this article, we introduce the principles and architectures of two new ontologies central to the task of semantic publishing: FaBiO, the FRBR-aligned Bibliographic Ontology, an ontology for recording and publishing bibliographic records of scholarly endeavours on the Semantic Web, and CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, an ontology for the characterization of bibliographic citations both factually and rhetorically. We present those two models step by step, in order to emphasise their features and to stress their advantages relative to other pre-existing information models. Finally, we review the uptake of FaBiO and CiTO within the academic and publishing communities.},

The article foregrounds the, hitherto unrecognized, diversity of existing legal design practice by drawing examples from across four fields of lawyering: legal practice, legal activism, policy making, and legal research. Emphasis is placed throughout on the need for a critical approach to legal design -- that is, for legal design to be thought about and done with a commitment to avoiding, exposing, and remedying biases and inequalities.},

Following political theorist Jane Bennett, these sites have the power to `enchant' and, in so doing, they are seedbeds of human generosity, ethical mindfulness, and care for the world at large. However, the means by which such enchantment is created, and the extent to which these intimate encounters with the prehistoric or historic record can be deliberately crafted, are little understood. Worsening the predicament, professional practices commonly thwart the potential for archaeology to provoke ethical action amongst humans. Here, I propose a multi-stranded conceptual model for generating enchantment with the archaeological record across both professional audiences and broader publics. With reference to the European Commission-funded EMOTIVE Project, I articulate one particular strand of this model: facilitated dialogue. Alongside exploring the role of digital culture in its advancement, I argue that an enchantment-led approach is imperative for achieving a truly socially-beneficial archaeological discipline.},

Given the diverse range of artifacts, objects, and documents comprising cultural heritage, it is essential to efficiently organize and provide access to these materials for the wider public. However, Peirce's manuscripts pose a particular challenge due to their extensive quantity, which makes comprehensive organization through manual classification practically impossible. In response to this challenge, our paper proposes a methodology for the automated analysis and organization of Peirce's manuscripts. We have specifically tested this approach on the renowned 115-page manuscript known as PAP. This study represents a significant step forward in establishing a research direction for the development of a larger project. By incorporating novel computational methods, this larger project has the potential to greatly enhance the field of cultural heritage organization.},

In the last years a number of different argument mark-up languages have been proposed in the context of tools developed for argument visualisation and construction (see [10] for a review). Thus, for example, the Assurance and Safety Case Environment (ASCE)1 is a graphical and narrative authoring tool for developing and managing assurance cases, safety cases and other complex project documentation.},

To redress this, the research community recently initiated work towards an Argument Interchange Format (AIF). The AIF aims to facilitate the exchange of semi-structured arguments among different argument analysis and argumentation-support tools. In this paper, we present a Description Logic ontology for annotating arguments, based on a new reification of the AIF and founded in Walton's theory of argumentation schemes. We demonstrate how this ontology enables a new kind of automated reasoning over argument structures, which complements classical reasoning about argument acceptability. In particular, Web Ontology Language reasoning enables significantly enhanced querying of arguments through automatic scheme classifications, instance classification, inference of indirect support in chained argument structures, and inference of critical questions. We present the implementation of a pilot Web-based system for authoring and querying argument structures using the proposed ontology.},

In this paper we reflect on the difficulties posed by this work, and we argue that it is a serious challenge which ought to be taken up within the digital humanities and related efforts to computationally support scholarly practice. Network analysis, bibliometrics, and stylometrics, essentially leave out the fundamental humanistic skill of charitable argument interpretation because they touch very little on the meanings embedded in texts. We present a problematisation of the design space for potential tool development, as a result of insights about the nature and form of arguments in historical texts gained from our attempt to locate and map the arguments in one corner of the Hathi Trust digital library.},

  abstract = {Much of the success of iconic interfaces has occurred within application domains in which a consistent metaphor can be maintained. However, this approach can prove problematic when icons are designed for cross-cultural applications - where a generic metaphor can often prove elusive. Even when a suitable metaphor can be found the problem remains of developing icons (within a given metaphorical framework) for all the functionality that may be required. Within certain application domains this difficulty has been overcome by means of the parallel use o f m o r e than one metaphor.This is certainly true of iconic interfaces to information delivery applications (where `book' and `travel' metaphors are relatively common). The universality of the book metaphor within modern culture and its relevance to many of the cognitive tasks involved in information delivery applications have provided the primary motivation for our adoption of this metaphor in much o f o u r work. However, we have also used multiple metaphor techniques for certain types of application. In this paper we describe the inter-relationship that exists between icons and metaphors and discuss the problems of designing iconic interfaces that embed useful metaphors. Various case studies are used to illustrate the issues raised and some outline conclusions derived from our work in this area are then presented.},

My analysis aims at demonstrating both the methodological weaknesses and open possibilities of postphenomenology. After summarizing its essentials, I will scrutinize, first, its ability to turn to the technological things themselves and, second, the so-called empirical turn as realized by postphenomenology. By assessing its conceptual framework from the phenomenological perspective, I hope to demonstrate that postphenomenology needs philosophical clarification and strengthening. In short, it needs a more phenomenological, and less pragmatic, approach to technology in its influence on human experience.},

Considering these contents separately hinders digital image retrieval because this creates a gap between the contents of the image and its representation. Therefore, this work aims to present a representation model of visual and non-visual information of digital images, with semantic enrichment through the Semantic Web technologies. For that, a qualitative methodology with a bibliographical approach was used. Theoretical subsidies of the topics addressed were sought, and it has an applied focus since it proposes a model and its exemplification. The developed model depicts the representation image process and allows the semantic enrichment of the data. This enrichment facilitates the retrieval in multiple contexts with technologies that favor the use of the data through inferences. Also, a use case with digital medical images is presented, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposal. It is concluded that the representation of visual and non-visual content aims to improve the way images are retrieved in digital information environments. The junction of the content and the context of images should be considered, even though search mechanisms usually treat this separately due to the disaggregation of image representation itself.},

  abstract = {Today, there is an emerging interest for the potential role of hermeneutics in reflecting on the practices related to digital technologies and their consequences. Nonetheless, such an interest has neither given rise to a unitary approach nor to a shared debate. The primary goal of this paper is to map and synthetize the different existing perspectives to pave the way for an open discussion on the topic. The article is developed in two steps. In the first section, the authors analyze digital hermeneutics ``in theory'' by confronting and systematizing the existing literature. In particular, they stress three main distinctions among the approaches: (1) between ``methodological'' and ``ontological'' digital hermeneutics; (2) between data- and text-oriented digital hermeneutics; and (3) between ``quantitative'' and ``qualitative'' credos in digital hermeneutics. In the second section, they consider digital hermeneutics ``in action'', by critically analyzing the uses of digital data (notably tweets) for studying a classical object such as the political opinion. In the conclusion, we will pave the way to an ontological turn in digital hermeneutics. Most of this article is devoted to the methodological issue of interpreting with digital machines. The main task of an ontological digital hermeneutics would consist instead in wondering if it is legitimate, and eventually to which extent, to speak of digital technologies, or at least of some of them, as interpretational machines.},

While philosophical in its orientation, the book covers a wide body of literature across science and technology studies, media studies, digital humanities, digital sociology, cognitive science, and the study of artificial intelligence. In the first part of the book, the author formulates an epistemological thesis according to which the "virtual never ended." Although the frontiers between the real and the virtual are certainly more porous today, they still exist and endure. In the book's second part, the author offers an ontological reflection on emerging digital technologies as "imaginative machines." He introduces the concept of emagination, arguing that human schematizations are always externalized into technologies, and that human imagination has its analog in the digital dynamics of articulation between databases and algorithms. The author takes an ethical and political stance in the concluding chapter. He resorts to the notion of "digital habitus" for claiming that within the digital we are repeatedly being reconducted to an oversimplified image and understanding of ourselves. Digital Hermeneutics will be of interest to scholars across a wide range of disciplines, including those working on philosophy of technology, hermeneutics, science and technology studies, media studies, and the digital humanities"--},

Development in cutting-edge technologies has brought changes in museum exhibitions to improve visitors' engagement and enhance their appreciation of the exhibits but most importantly the heritage which is being showcased. Technology integration in museum exhibits would enables curators to create interactive and multi-sensory UX for museum visitors. Hence, the current paper presents the conceptual framework of the digital storytelling (DST) elements on information visualisation (InfoVis) museum exhibition for user experience (UX). To date, there is an absence of explicit reports on DST elements used in museum exhibition content in designing the exhibition product narration but further exploration is recommended. Utilising the systematic literature review (SLR) method on this study through literature review of DST elements and InfoVis types addressing museum exhibition for user experience (UX), the review is expanded on the technique of enhancement in museum exhibition. However, it is important to identify what are the DST elements and InfoVis types used in contemporary museum exhibitions especially in the National Museum Department (Jabatan Muzium Negara) (JMN) within the Klang Valley area. Additionally, users' reactions towards museum exhibition and curator feedback on what are the best DST elements and InfoVis types will be applied for future museum exhibition in Malaysia for improvised user experience (UX).},

While several benchmarks and benchmark generation frameworks have been developed to evaluate triple stores, they mostly provide a one-fits-all solution to the benchmarking problem. This approach to benchmarking is however unsuitable to evaluate the performance of a triple store for a given application with particular requirements. We address this drawback by presenting FEASIBLE, an automatic approach for the generation of benchmarks out of the query history of applications, i.e., query logs. The generation is achieved by selecting prototypical queries of a user-defined size from the input set of queries. We evaluate our approach on two query logs and show that the benchmarks it generates are accurate approximations of the input query logs. Moreover, we compare four different triple stores with benchmarks generated using our approach and show that they behave differently based on the data they contain and the types of queries posed. Our results suggest that FEASIBLE generates better sample queries than the state of the art. In addition, the better query selection and the larger set of query types used lead to triple store rankings which partly differ from the rankings generated by previous works.},

A number of SPARQL query containment solvers for SPARQL have been recently developed. To the best of our knowledge, the Query Containment Benchmark (QC-Bench) is the only benchmark for evaluating these containment solvers. However, this benchmark contains a fixed number of synthetic queries, which were handcrafted by its creators. We propose SQCFramework, a SPARQL query containment benchmark generation framework which is able to generate customized SPARQL containment benchmarks from real SPARQL query logs. The framework is flexible enough to generate benchmarks of varying sizes and according to the user-defined criteria on the most important SPARQL features to be considered for query containment benchmarking. This is achieved using different clustering algorithms. We compare state-of-the-art SPARQL query containment solvers by using different query containment benchmarks generated from DBpedia and Semantic Web Dog Food query logs. In addition, we analyze the quality of the different benchmarks generated by SQCFramework.},

We propose LargeRDFBench, a billion-triple benchmark for SPARQL query federation which encompasses real data as well as real queries pertaining to real bio-medical use cases. We evaluate state-of-the-art SPARQL endpoint federation approaches on this benchmark with respect to their query runtime, triple pattern-wise source selection, number of endpoints requests, and result completeness and correctness. Our evaluation results suggest that the performance of current SPARQL query federation systems on simple queries (in terms of total triple patterns, query result set sizes, execution time, use of SPARQL features etc.) does not reflect the systems' performance on more complex queries. Moreover, current federation systems seem unable to deal with real queries that involve processing large intermediate result sets or lead to large result sets.},

Over recent years, various benchmarks have been proposed to assess the performance of triplestores across different performance measures. However, choosing the most suitable benchmark for evaluating triplestores in practical settings is not a trivial task. This is because triplestores experience varying workloads when deployed in real applications. We address the problem of determining an appropriate benchmark for a given real-life workload by providing a fine-grained comparative analysis of existing triplestore benchmarks. In particular, we analyze the data and queries provided with the existing triplestore benchmarks in addition to several real-world datasets. Furthermore, we measure the correlation between the query execution time and various SPARQL query features and rank those features based on their significance levels. Our experiments reveal several interesting insights about the design of such benchmarks. With this fine-grained evaluation, we aim to support the design and implementation of more diverse benchmarks. Application developers can use our result to analyze their data and queries and choose a data management system.},

Inferring coherence relations, such as cause-consequence and claim-argument, is a necessary condition for a discourse representation to be coherent. Despite some descriptively fairly adequate proposals in the literature, there is still no theoretically satisfying account of the links that make a discourse coherent. An adequate account of the relations establishing coherence has to be psychologically plausible, because coherence relations are ultimately cognitive relations. We are proposing a taxonomy that classifies coherence relations in terms of four cognitively salient primitives, such as the polarity of the relation and the pragmatic or semantic character of the link between the units. A classification experiment using fragments of written discourse showed that the 12 classes of coherence relations distinguished in the taxonomy appear to be intuitively plausible and applicable. A second experiment investigating the use of connectives provided further evidence for the psychological salience of the taxonomic primitives and their relevance to the understanding of coherence relations.}

Developed by conceptualizing authoritative knowledge and notions taken from Panofsky's levels of interpretation theory, ICON ontology focuses on the granularity of interpretations. It can be used to describe an interpretation of an artwork from the pre-iconographical, icongraphical, and iconological levels. Its main classes have been aligned to ontologies that come from the domains of cultural descriptions (ArCo, CIDOC-CRM, VIR), semiotics (DOLCE), bibliometrics (CITO), and symbolism (Simulation Ontology), to grant a robust schema that can be extendable using additional classes and properties coming from these ontologies. The ontology was evaluated through competency questions that range from simple recognition on a specific level of interpretation to complex scenarios. Data written using this model was compared to state-of-the-art ontologies and schemas to both highlight the current lack of a domain-specific ontology on art interpretation and show how our work fills some of the current gaps. The ontology is openly available and compliant with FAIR principles. With our ontology, we hope to encourage digital art historians working for cultural institutions in making more detailed linked open data about the content of their artifacts, to exploit the full potential of Semantic Web in linking artworks through not only subjects and common metadata but also specific symbolic interpretations, intrinsic meanings, and the motifs through which their subjects are represented. Additionally, by basing our work on theories made by different art history scholars in the last century, we make sure that their knowledge and studies will not be lost in the transition to the digital, linked open data era.},

Time-consuming and laborious attention to textual discussions is needed to make such decisions, for which computer support would be beneficial. Yet there has been little study of the argumentation patterns that distributed ad-hoc online task groups use in evaluation and decision-making. In a corpus of English Wikipedia deletion discussions, we investigate the argumentation schemes used, the role of the arguer's experience, and which arguments are acceptable to the audience. We report three main results: First, the most prevalent patterns are the Rules and Evidence schemes from Walton's catalog of argumentation schemes [33], which comprise 36\% of arguments. Second, we find that familiarity with community norms correlates with the novices' ability to craft persuasive arguments. Third, acceptable arguments use community-appropriate rhetoric that demonstrate knowledge of policies and community values while problematic arguments are based on personal preference and inappropriate analogy to other cases.},

This expansion from an algorithm-focused view to embrace a human-centered perspective can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. Educators, designers, software engineers, product managers, evaluators, and government agency staffers can build on AI-driven technologies to design products and services that make life better for people and enable people to care for each other. Humans have always been tool builders, and now they are supertool builders, whose inventions can improve our health, family life, education, business, the environment, and much more. The remarkable progress in algorithms for machine and deep learning have opened the doors to new opportunities, and some dark possibilities. However, a bright future awaits AI researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers, and others who build on their working methods by including HCAI strategies of design and testing. This enlarged vision can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. As many technology companies and thought leaders have said, the goal is not to replace people, but to empower them by making design choices that give humans control over technology.},

Therefore, we conducted a questionnaire study with ChatGPT users (N=194), inquiring about their good and poor experiences with ChatGPT. The user reports were analyzed by a thematic analysis and systematized through a pragmatic-hedonic framework. Our results demonstrate how user experience is influenced by pragmatic attributes such as ChatGPT providing useful and detailed information and easing work- or school-related tasks. Additionally, user experience is impacted by hedonic attributes, such as entertainment and creative interactions, and interactions leaving the user impressed or surprised. Our study underscores that user experience concerning conversational AI like ChatGPT is assessed by useful and productive interactions even in early phase of uptake, suggesting the importance of pragmatic attributes.},

  abstract = {The project "The School of Salamanca" is creating a freely-accessible online collection of texts produced in the intellectual centre of the Spanish monarchy during the XVI and XVII centuries. Currently 33 works have completed the production cycle (out of total 116) which includes TEI XML encoding, HTML export for the online access and full-text search, IIIF presentation APIs, PDF, and RDF export. The development of a sustainable workflow for the project has been influenced by the massive size of our textual collection and its unique features. In preparing editions of Early Modern Latin and Spanish texts it is crucial to take into account their inherent instability, i.e. heterogeneous structures, orthographic, typographical, and punctuation variations etc. Our editorial principles were therefore shaped by the necessity to trace and reproduce the development steps at any given moment; to reuse tools independent of the context and individual texts; to scale the complex processing tasks; to perform constant data quality checks, and to document the requirements and the results. Salamanca's workflow shares common ground with both Waterfall and Agile development techniques. The concept of pipeline, inherent to Waterfall, is in the centre of Salamanca's editorial technique: the production on the edition consists of a number of steps executed sequentially, where the output of each stage serves as the input for the next one. Digitization {$\rightarrow$} Transcription in TEI TITE {$\rightarrow$} Structural annotation {$\rightarrow$} TEI transformation {$\rightarrow$} Manual and automatic corrections {$\rightarrow$} HTML, PDF, IIIF, and RDF generation. The advantage of such a predefined sequence is its reproducibility, where each part of an editorial process can be restored at any time. It makes individual work steps traceable and enables comprehensive documentation in form of the program code and editorial guidelines. In Agile, the software product is built in small chunks, and each of the development cycles includes feature clarification, design, coding, testing and deployment. For this purpose Agile integrates the software development, testing and operations teams in a single collaborative iterative process. In Salamanca's adoption of Agile practises each of the above-mentioned development stages contains the definition of the requirements, development and quality assurance. This also means that each stage of the production of the digital edition delivers a part of the overall product features, which can be accessed and disseminated. For example, the QA routines after step 1 - digitization of the print originals - allow us to publish the IIIF presentation manifests even before the TEI transcription starts. IIIF manifests are later enriched with additional data, pertaining to chapters and pagination. The same applies to PDF generation -- it was initially intended to be one of the export methods, located at the end of the workflow. Yet, when implemented, it exposed a number of semantic and structural inconsistencies of the source XML. We therefore decided to use PDF earlier in the pipeline as a diagnostic tool and data quality service. In our talk we will show how the sustainable editorial workflow, adapted for processing of large-scale textual sources, translates into the delivery of high-quality data},

These tools, that we call cumulatively Explanatory AI (YAI) systems, enhance the quality of the basic output of a XAI by adopting a user-centred approach to explanation that can cater to the individual needs of the explainees with measurable improvements in usability. Our approach is based on Achinstein's theory of explanations, where explaining is an illocutionary (i.e., broad yet pertinent and deliberate) act of pragmatically answering a question. Accordingly, user-centrality enters in the equation by considering that the overall amount of information generated by answering all questions can rapidly become overwhelming and that individual users may perceive the need to explore just a few of them. In this paper, we give the theoretical foundations of YAI, formally defining a user-centred explanatory tool and the space of all possible explanations, or explanatory space, generated by it. To this end, we frame the explanatory space as an hypergraph of knowledge and we identify a set of heuristics and properties that can help approximating a decomposition of it into a tree-like representation for efficient and user-centred explanation retrieval. Finally, we provide some old and new empirical results to support our theory, showing that explanations are more than textual or visual presentations of the sole information provided by a XAI.},

Most of these developments occur in the mature Peirce after the turn of the century and thus form an important part of his mature semiotics -- yet, they do not relate in any simple or straight-forward manner to his attempts at enlarging his combinatorial semiotics from its bases in the three-trichotomy theory of the 1903               Syllabus               over the six-trichotomy theory of 1904--1906 to the sketchlike ten-trichotomy version of 1908, where diagrams rarely figure in the names of sign-types discussed -- why?},

Within Human Computer Interaction, researchers are developing these from low-resolution, low-fidelity prototypes, toward a vision of a truly malleable world. The main focus is in producing and testing hardware, and basic user interactions, which leaves the question unanswered: what are shape-changing interfaces good for? In response, we propose the use of design fiction to investigate potential applications for this technology: to create and analyse artifacts relating to future use-scenarios for shape-change. Whilst research within shape-change often proposes future usecases for prototypes during discussion, they are seldom in a form that presents them as everyday artifacts. Here, we present and discuss a printed game-play instruction manual for a truly high resolution shape-changing game entitled First Hand, which aims to draw parallels between current gaming practices and the tangible nature of shape-changing interfaces.},

Engineering a shared ontology is a social process. Since its participants have slightly different views on the world, a harmonization effort requires discussing the resulting ontology. During the discussion, participants exchange arguments which may support or object to certain ontology engineering decisions. Experience from software engineering shows that tracking exchanged arguments can help users at a later stage to better understand the assumptions underlying the design decisions. Furthermore, as the constructed ontology becomes larger, ontology engineers might argue in a contradictory way without knowing so. In this paper we present an ontology which formalizes the main concepts which are used in an DILIGENT ontology engineering discussion and thus enables tracking arguments and allows for inconsistency detection. We provide an example which is drawn from experiments in an ontology engineering process to construct an ontology for knowledge management in our institute. Having constructed the ontology we also show how automated ontology learning algorithms could be taken as participants in the OE discussion. Hence, we enable the integration of manual, semi-automatic and automatic ontology creation approaches.},

Furthermore, we benchmark two common approaches for evaluating taxonomic queries either on-the-fly (ISA, NOISA, Hybrid), or by precomputing the transitive closure of subsumption relationships (MatView, URI, ID). The main conclusion drawn from our experiments is that the evaluation of taxonomic queries is most efficient over RDF/S stores utilizing the Hybrid and MatView representations. Of the rest, schema-aware representations (ISA, NOISA) exhibit overall better performance than URI, which is superior to that of ID, which exhibits the overall worst performance.},

Visualizations that, purposely or not, obscure or remove uncertainty in its different forms from the scholars' vision may negatively affect the manner in which humanities scholars regard computational methods as useful tools in their daily work. In this paper, we address the issue of uncertainty representation in the context of the humanities from a theoretical perspective, in an attempt to provide the foundations of a framework that allows for the construction of ecological interface designs which are able to expose the computational power of the algorithms at play while, at the same time, respecting the particularities and needs of humanistic research. To this end, we review past uncertainty taxonomies in other domains typically related to the humanities and visualization, such as cartography and GIScience. From this review, we select an uncertainty taxonomy related to the humanities that we link to recent research in visualization for the DH. Finally, we bring a novel analytics method developed by other authors (Progressive Visual Analytics) into question, which we argue can be a good candidate to resolve the aforementioned difficulties in DH practice.},

A deployment at a library revealed that visitors embraced this approach of utilizing visualization to support open-ended explorations and serendipitous discoveries.

Two are, in these archival collections, the interesting features to stress: the heterogeneity of documents (both by type and support) and the suite of relationships, even latent, that these documents would carry out (between people, between a person and the archival collection, and, in particular, between a person and other related resources). Ontologies are a decisive step in building LOD. Though not explicitly included in the `5 stars' by Tim Berners Lee, conceptual models are able to provide the semantic deepness needed to enhance the domain description, by giving value to typed link and extending, as a result, the network of interconnection. The project realized on the archive by Federico Zeri, held at the University of Bologna, can be a useful starting point for rethinking the archival description in a GLAM environment.},

We answer these research questions by first describing a conceptual framework that brings together (i) the information that is primarily relevant in sets (i.e., set membership, set attributes, and element attributes) and (ii) different plausible categories of (un)certainty (i.e., certainty, undefined uncertainty as a binary fact, and defined uncertainty as quantifiable measure). Following the structure of our framework, we systematically discuss basic visualization examples of integrating uncertainty in set visualizations.

We leverage the TrOCR architecture and integrate domain-specific large language models (LLM). This HTR approach show promising results on contemporary documents but the application on historical manuscripts and low-resource languages need domain pre-trained Image models to encode sequential data and adapted LLM's to adequately decode the signals. Furthermore, as training pairs from medieval manuscripts are scarce a synthetic dataset generated using GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks) augmentation techniques will be used during training. For this work, the annotated training dataset comprises more of 2 million tokens and 210,000 graphical text-lines coming from 52 different manuscripts in mostly four ancient languages versions for Latin, French, Spanish and High German. The synthetic GAN dataset comprises 420k graphical lines emulating textual and graphical features from the ground-truth. The results shows relative improvements until 30\% in CER, WER and BERT-score compared to CRNN only solutions. This study outlines the following: the training architecture and corpora employed; delves into the encountered challenges during training and validation concerning ancient writing practices, and conducts an analysis of the potential biases and strengths associated with the joint application of vision transformers, GAN's and LLMs for HTR tasks.},

  abstract = {Provenance disclosure---the documentation of an artifact's origin and how it was produced---is an important aspect to consider when working with historical records which undergo multiple transformations in preparation for and during digitization. Provenance in this context is commonly communicated through explanatory text or static diagrams. However, the methodological and curatorial decisions that have influenced the records' data are easily overlooked, in particular when exploring the records through visualization as a result of digitization processes. We propose a data-driven approach to provenance disclosure which (1) traces provenance back to when the records were created, (2) documents and categorizes the records' transformations (transcriptions, content modifications, changes in organization, and representational form), and (3) uses data visualization to disclose provenance in interactive ways. We reflect on how this approach can be practically applied in the context of historical record collections, and we present findings from a qualitative study we conducted to investigate the merits and limitations of provenance-driven visualization. Our findings suggest that data-driven provenance disclosure has the potential to (1) promote transparency and deeper interpretations of historical records, (2) provide rigor in researching historical document collections and underlying production processes, and (3) encourage ethical considerations by making visible labor and implicit bias that influence the production and curation of historical records.},

In this work, we present the Agora project, an interdisciplinary project in which Web technology and theory of interpretation meet. This we call digital hermeneutics. The Agora project facilitates the understanding of historical events and improves the access to integrated online history collections. In this contribution, we focus on defining and modeling prototypical object-event and event-event relationships that support the interpretation of objects in cultural heritage collections. We present a use case in which we model historical events as well as relations between objects and events for a set of paintings from the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam collection. Our use case shows how Web technology and theory of interpretation meet in the present, and what technological hurdles still need to be taken to fully support digital hermeneutics.},

Rather, an effective delivery of arguments follows a rhetorical strategy, combining logical reasoning with appeals to ethics and emotion. We argue that such a strategy means to select, arrange, and phrase a set of argumentative discourse units. In this paper, we model rhetorical strategies for the computational synthesis of effective argumentation. In a study, we let 26 experts synthesize argumentative texts with different strategies for 10 topics. We find that the experts agree in the selection significantly more when following the same strategy. While the texts notably vary for different strategies, especially their arrangement remains stable. The results suggest that our model enables a strategical synthesis.}

Visualization approaches to corresponding data and topics are currently learning to deal with various aspects of uncertainty and ambiguity; yet, design practice and theoretical reflections cannot rely on a mature footing until now. With this position paper, we draw together theses about the role and relevance of uncertainty representations, which are commonly lauded for their contribution to truthfulness and the creation of trust. But when we look more closely at the main target groups of collection visualizations we arrive at two propositions: (1) Casual users will rather put trust into simpler and clearer visualizations with less visual complexity. (2) Humanist inquiry focuses on uncertainties about the meaning and relevance of cultural objects, whereas visualization commonly represents only uncertainties in well-defined metadata dimensions---A mismatch that reduces usefulness and probably also trust. By taking knowledge about different users into account, we aim to sharpen the standard rationale of uncertainty representation in our field and foster both advanced uncertainty visualization design for experts, as well as adaptive or lightweight approaches for casual users.},

Unlike the traditional assistance design tools, AIAD focuses on the rational use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology to measure and improve UX since conventional data collection methods (such as user interview and user observation) for user behavior data are inefficient and time-consuming. We propose to obtain user behavior data from logs of mobile application. In order to protect the privacy of users, only a few dimensions of information is used in the process of browsing and operating mobile application. The goal of the proposed methodology is to make the deep neural network model simulate the user's experience in the process of operating a mobile application as much as possible. We design and use projected pages of application to train neural networks for specific tasks. These projected pages consist of the click information of all users in the process of completing a certain task. Thus, features of user behavior can be aggregated and mapped in the connection layers and the hidden layers.

  abstract = {Data Provenance has created an emerging requirement for technologies that enable end users to access, evaluate, and act on the provenance of data in recent years. In the era of Big Data, the amount of data created by corporations around the world has grown each year. As an example, both in the Social Media and e-Science domains, data is growing at an unprecedented rate. As the data has grown rapidly, information on the origin and lifecycle of the data has also grown. In turn, this requires technologies that enable the clarification and interpretation of data through the use of data provenance. This study proposes methodologies towards the visualization of W3C-PROV-O Specification compatible provenance data. The visualizations are done by summarization and comparison of the data provenance. We facilitated the testing of these methodologies by providing a prototype, extending an existing open source visualization tool. We discuss the usability of the proposed methodologies with an experimental study; our initial results show that the proposed approach is usable, and its processing overhead is negligible.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the importance to integrate user experience (UX) in cultural heritage digitisation and preservation initiatives. UX is an essential consideration that should be acknowledged and implemented when initiating digital culture heritage preservation. It is because UX is beyond the usability of a product or system. It includes both pragmatic (function and features) and hedonic (user expectation, motivation and feelings) factors. These attributes could influence user's positive experience when interacting with the system or product and this will lead to effectiveness of digitisation and preservation activities. The output from this study will propose the approach towards integrating UX and gather insights for future initiatives in establishing cultural and heritage digital preservation that consider effective UX to encourage user satisfaction.},

  author = {Zamborlini, Veruska and Guizzardi, Giancarlo},
  abstract = {In this paper we present an approach for representing temporally changing information in OWL. This approach is based on a reification strategy founded on results from the philosophical discipline of Formal Ontology. These results grant ontological meaning to the reified individuals (intrinsic and relational properties) and provide an ontological semantics to the resulting specification. We also propose here some methodological guidelines for guiding the use of the proposed framework in supporting modeling decisions in OWL. By using the proposed framework, one can represent domain information regarding sources of temporal change such as the distinction between necessary versus contingent properties, or mutable versus immutable ones. Finally, we compare the proposed approach with another commonly used strategy for circumventing OWL{\textasciiacute}s limitation w.r.t. temporally changing information.},

  abstract = {We introduce SRBench, a general-purpose benchmark primarily designed for streaming RDF/SPARQL engines, completely based on real-world data sets from the Linked Open Data cloud. With the increasing problem of too much streaming data but not enough tools to gain knowledge from them, researchers have set out for solutions in which Semantic Web technologies are adapted and extended for publishing, sharing, analysing and understanding streaming data. To help researchers and users comparing streaming RDF/SPARQL (strRS) engines in a standardised application scenario, we have designed SRBench, with which one can assess the abilities of a strRS engine to cope with a broad range of use cases typically encountered in real-world scenarios. The data sets used in the benchmark have been carefully chosen, such that they represent a realistic and relevant usage of streaming data. The benchmark defines a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries that cover the major aspects of strRS processing. Finally, our work is complemented with a functional evaluation on three representative strRS engines: SPARQLStream, C-SPARQL and CQELS. The presented results are meant to give a first baseline and illustrate the state-of-the-art.},

  abstract = {Wikidata has been widely used in Digital Humanities (DH) projects. However, a focused discussion regarding the current status, potential, and challenges of its application in the field is still lacking. A systematic review was conducted to identify and evaluate how DH projects perceive and utilize Wikidata, as well as its potential and challenges as demonstrated through use. This research concludes that: (1) Wikidata is understood in the DH projects as a content provider, a platform, and a technology stack; (2) it is commonly implemented for annotation and enrichment, metadata curation, knowledge modelling, and Named Entity Recognition (NER); (3) Most projects tend to consume data from Wikidata, whereas there is more potential to utilize it as a platform and a technology stack to publish data on Wikidata or to create an ecosystem of data exchange; and (4) Projects face two types of challenges: technical issues in the implementations and concerns with Wikidata's data quality. In the discussion, this article contributes to addressing three issues related to coping with the challenges in the specific context of the DH field based on the research findings: the relevance and authority of other available domain sources; domain communities and their practices; and workflow design that coordinates technical and labour resources from projects and Wikidata.},
